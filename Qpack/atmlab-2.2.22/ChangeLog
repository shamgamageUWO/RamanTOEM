2014-08-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-2-7

	* A revision of the gformat related function. The only real change
	is described in the two first bullets below.

	* gformat/griddedfield2gf.m: Now only handling single G and GF.
	All other code removed (not sure if it worked). This as
	"vectorisation" has been removed from all other parts of gformat.

	Copied the sub-function from gf_artsxml, as doing the same thing
	but handles more forms of data.

	* gformat/gf_artsxml.m: Now using griddedfield2gf. This to avoid
	having duplicated code. That is, the sub-function is removed
	(rather moved to griddedfield2gf).

	  fixed the issue with changing Variable names within V1.06 
	  Now the different Incidence_Angle Variable decriptions are both 
	  possible 
	  the  small bug call hdf5info was inverted as some other calls need 
	  it but inreoduced another call to enable the reading of nionzipped 
	  files which need the call.
          info=h5info(filename);

2014-07-14  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

2014-06-23  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-2-2

	* math/binning_fast.m: Generalizing even more: Now you can pass
	the argument in.counts = true, if you only want the number of hits
	(numel) per grid, and don't want to actually grid any data. This
	is much faster than binning the data and then getting the numel
	from binned_statitics.m as before


2014-06-19  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-2-1

	* datasets/define_datasets.m: Added missing value definintion to some datasets

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Prepend "gmtfile_" to default filename
	when using in.header to build filename

	* handy/PersistentCachedData.m: Puny change in output text

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: No longer allow an empty title to be used as a filename

	* math/binned_statistics.m: Fixed documentation

	* math/binning_fast.m:

	- Updated function to be general for most puposes and not just for
	geographical data as the previous version.

	- The function is still completey backward compatible but now one
	can grid 'Z' with the coorinates 'X' and 'Y' into a grid with the
	centers defined by 'newX' and 'newY'.

	- If you data 'X','Y','Z' is used instead of 'data','lat','lon',
	no geographical sanitity checks are performed

2014-06-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-2-0

	* 2.2 Release

2014-06-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-504

	* arts/netcdf/arts_nc_read_arrayofmatrix.m,
	arts/netcdf/arts_nc_read_arrayofvector.m:

	Replace obsolete inqVarId with 'new' inqVarID to fix reading of ARTS
	arrays.

2014-06-03  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>

	* atmlab-2-1-503

	* retrieval/spareice/Contents.m:

	- Expanded explanations a bit

	* retrieval/spareice/cfsr_month2day.py:

	- Python script to convert CFSR data as downloaded from the archive,
	to a format to be understood by the atmlab reading routine

	* retrieval/spareice/compare_collocated_iwp_products.m:

	- Do not call this function.  It is needed because of some oddities
	with the storage of the neural nets (see function header for details).

	* datasets/GriddedDataset.m:

	- Bugfix when ttime_i gets negative. Not 100% sure why that happens
	but chosen the least bad solution.  If anyone notices that the first
	day of the month looks significantly worse than other days, please
	look in this file around ttime_i<=0 and start debugging there.

2014-05-27  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@utoronto.ca>

	* atmlab-2-1-502

	* datasets/GriddedDataset.m:

	- Give a friendly error message on missing data (such as the case for
	CFSR)

	* retrieval/spareice/*:

	- Copied codes from my personal svn repository.  Note that these codes
	are raw and uncut and poorly documented and not up to atmlab
	standards.  Use with extreme care.  See retrieval/spareice/Contents.m.
	I purposefully did *not* include this directory in the atmlab path
	through atmlab_init.  Do this by hand if you want to use the functions
	and classes here.  They presently might or might not work.  I will
	likely adapt this in the coming days.

2014-05-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-501

	* h2o/parametrisations/n_ice_warren84.m (n_ice_warren84): New.

2014-03-21  Carlos Jimenez    <carlos.jimenez@estellus.fr>

	* atmlab-2-1-487

	* arts/xml/xmlWriteNumeric.m: it seems to me that there was a bug
	in fprintf (fid, [xmlGetPrecisionFormatString (precision)
	'\n'], data). Replaced with fprintf (fid,
	[xmlGetPrecisionFormatString(precision) '\n'], data);

2014-03-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-486

	* sensors/backend_amsutype.m: New.

2014-03-19  Mathias Milz  <mathias.milz@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-485

	* arts/xml/xmlWriteSparseData.m:
	      removed blank between function name and bracket
	      in call to xmlGetPrecisionFormatString. This caused an error.

2014-03-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-484

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: Spell fixes of header. Planet

2014-03-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-483

	* forwardmodel/n_air_thayer.m: New.

	* atmlab-2-1-481

	* scattering/Asymmetry_parameter.m: extracts the asymmetry parameter
	from an array of ARTS single scattering data. 

2014-02-12  Carlos Jimenez    <carlos.jimenez@estellus.fr>

	* atmlab-2-1-480

	* physics/constants: updating 'GAS_CONST_DRY_AIR' from 287.04 to
	287.058 (as given in the mentioned reference).
	
	* physics/airdensity.m: trivial mscript to calculate the dry air
	density.
	
	* geophysics/mixra2massconc.m: Updating the description (wrong
	units) and using the built-in mscript airdensity.

2014-02-12  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-479

	* graphs/scatter_density_plot.m:

	- Update documentation for medprops to describe a feature that was
	implemented a while ago (two medprops structs in an array)

	* math/binned_statistics.m:

	- Allow to pass more than one filter in a cell array, and they will
	all be applied.

	* geographical/sun_angles.m, handy/cur.m, handy/cached_evaluation.m,
	handy/par.m:

	- Added/expanded "See also" to documentation.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:

	- Fix typo in documentation

	* handy/getfields.m:

	- Don't crash if zero fields are requested

	* handy/PersistentCachedData.m:

	- Use Matlabs internal functions to get last-modified-date for
	persistent cached file, no need to go through 'ls -l' unless I'm
	missing something

	* datasets/SatDataset.m(level3):

	- Improved a lot, it could even possibly work now, if you're lucky and
	circumstances are right and the moon is full and in the right
	constellation.

	* datasets/GriddedDataset.m(read_from_grid):

	- Improved this quite a while ago, don't even remember what/why.

	* datasets/+satreaders/patmosxL3.m:

	- Uncomment time-setting

2014-01-29  Carlos Jimenez    <carlos.jimenez@estellus.fr>

	* atmlab-2-1-478

	* geophysics/mxr2masscon: updating the mscript by using the
	GAS_CONST_DRY_AIR from the atmlab constants, missed that in
	previous commitment.


2014-01-28  Carlos Jimenez    <carlos.jimenez@estellus.fr>

	* atmlab-2-1-477

	* geophysics/mxr2masscon: very simple mscript to convert mass
	mixing ratio (Kg/Kg) to mass concentration (Kg/m3), assuming a
	mixture of species/hydrometeor in dry air.

2014-01-19  Ole Martin Christensen  <olem@chalmers.se>

	* arts/qarts_vmr_field.m: Fixed bug in the latest update made the atmdata (G) to continiously beeing overwrite.

	* arts/qarts_atm_field.m: Same as above.

2014-01-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-476

	* math/step_transition.m:
	* math/linear_transition.m: New. 

2014-01-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-475

	* retrieval/mci.m: Seems that nargout can be corrupted inside a
	parfor loop. So now nargout copied to a local variable. But
	removed parfor matlab anyhow goes beyond 100% with just a for
	loop, and then did not bother to track down some other error just
	occuring with parfor.

2014-01-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-474

	* demos/qpack2_t_demo.m (y_demo): Fixed typo.

	* math/full_or_sparse.m: New.

	* retrieval/oem.m: When calculated internally, Seinv and Sxinv are
	passed through full_or_sparse.

	xnorm is now ensured to be full. If sparse is inherited from Sx,
	this gives an overhead further down. Pointed out by Ole Martin.

	* arts/arts_oem.m: The rescaling of J for "rel" now done
	column-by-column. The old version hit the memory roof for large J.
	And new solution in fact faster (60% saving), at least for my test
	with a J of 3.3 GB.

2014-01-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-473

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (cfile_RteExe): Commented out saving of y_f,
	y_pol, y_pos and y_los.

	* demos/qarts_zeeman_demo.m:
	* demos/qarts_mcdoit_demo.m:
	* demos/qarts_scattering_demo.m:
	* demos/qarts_backend_demo.m:
	* demos/qarts_demo2.m:
	* demos/qarts_demo.m: Adopted call of arts_y.

	* arts/arts_y.m (arts_y): Removed ydata as output. For larger
	calculations, the reading of y_pol takes a lot of time, that should
	be avoided. This information can be recreated in other ways. And I
	assume that nobody is using ydata. If you do, tell me and I will
	find some alternative solution.

	* arts/qarts_vmr_field.m:
	* arts/qarts_atm_field.m: Both functions restructured and partly
	rewritten. Earlier version did not handle all 2D cases.

	* gridcreation/grid_weightspaced.m: Changed from using cumsum to
	cumtrapz. This gives a better treatment of end points, and also
	allows handling of non-uniform grids.

2013-12-18  Carlos Jimenez    <carlos.jimenez@estellus.fr>

	* atmlab-2-1-472

	* geophysics/mixr2vmr.m: small change of units, better to leave

2013-12-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-471

	* retrieval/oem.m: Fixed small typo in header. Characterisation

2013-12-11  Carlos Jimenez    <carlos.jimenez@estellus.fr>

	* atmlab-2-1-470

	* geophysics/mixr2vmr.m: simple mscript to convert mass mixing
	ratio to volume mixing ratio.

	* geoplots/gmt/makepolar.m:
	-Fixed bug in number format string (small numbers are also allowed
	now)
	- Fixed bug if the reference value is at or outside the data range
	edges.

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m:
	- Made help section human-readible

	- default behaviour is now to name the outfile after the title (if
	given) and if no in.filename is given

	- fixed the default viewer to 'gnone-open' or 'kde-open' if on
	linux, and 'open' if on a Mac

	* handy/sanitise.m: silenced annoying warning about dangerous characters

	* datasets/define_datasets.m: Added modis field

2013-11-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-462

	* retrieval/mci.m (mci): Added some comments. More importantly,
	the function can now make use parallelisation. To make use of this
	feature, first call matlabpool.

2013-11-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-461

	* arts/arts_x2QR.m: Pointing off-set were put into Q.SENSOR_LOS,
	but needs to be stored to used file to have an effect. This should
	hopefully fix problem reported by Ole Martin.

	Also added this if-statement:

	if do_sensor
	  arts_sensor( Q, R.workfolder );
        end

2013-11-06  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-460

	* geographical/regionize.m: Puny string edit

2013-11-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-459

	* pyarts: Removed the folder and its content. As far as I know,
	not used by anyone and probably not working. The same
	functionality now exists inside ARTS, that can be used by
	tmatrix.m.

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Removed adding of pyarts folder.

2013-11-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-458

	* scattering/tmatrix.m: Changed to use the temporary method
	scat_meta_arrayAddTmatrixOldVersion.

2013-10-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-457

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D_slta.m: Changed gps/leo to rec/tra,
	as earlier done in function below.

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: Added workfolder as optional
	argument.

2013-10-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-456

	* demos/qarts_demo.m: Updated setting of SURFACE_RTPROP_AGENDA

2013-10-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-455

	* sensors/atovs/atovs_read_data.m: Reactivated the last two lines.

2013-10-25  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-454

	* geodetic/geographic_mean.m: Added, forgot to add earlier!

2013-10-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-453

	* sensors/atovs/atovs_read_data.m (atovs_read_data): I had to
	comment out two last line as the function geographic_mean is not
	in atmlab.

	* h2o/parametrisations/eps_water_liebe93.m: Polished header.

2013-10-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-452

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_jupiter_planettbox.m: Quickly fixed header.
	Wind and magnetic field parts are not handled, but no time to
	fix those parts now.

2013-10-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-451

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_jupiter_planettbox.m: Just started. Handles
	the basic atmosphere, but not winds etc. And header text not completed.

2013-10-21  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-450

	* datasets/GriddedDataset.m:

	- Added.  First working functionality is here.  For a gridded dataset,
	i.e. time/lat/lon stored per day, obtain data purely based on
	time/lat/lon.  Will be needed to add reanalysis data to SPARE-ICE.

	* datasets/+satreaders/*:

	- Add notice on where to read help on the common format

	* math/binned_statistics.m:

	- Bugfix, have default option for non-mandatory argument 'opt'

	* math/DataHash.m:

	- Prevent infinite loop in case of function handles in workspace.
	This infinite loop is replaced by the new problem that non-unique hash
	can be generated, but I think this is less bad (one anyway shouldn't
	use DataHash for safety-critical situations, nor Matlab at all).

	* collocations/FieldMultiInstrumentCopier.m:

	- Fix typo in documentations

	* datasets/define_datasets.m, site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Add CFSR

	* datasets/+satreaders/ncep_cfsr_day.m:

	- Add reading routine for NCEP CFSR reanalysis data sorted per day by
	Python script commited seperately in gerrits internal svn (ask if
	interested).

	* handy/CachedData.m(cached_evaluation):

	- Bugfix, if calling same method on different objects.  Workaround:
	able to pass additional stuff that's taken into the hash-calculations
	but not passed on to the called function.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	- Microscopic change

2013-10-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-449

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D_slta.m: The _power function renamed.
	Header partly rewritten, to reflect changes.

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: Extended. Now also covering
	attenuation, vene for individual abs_species.

2013-10-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-444

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D_power.m: Added optional fields
	O.defoc_shift and O.defoc_method.

2013-10-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-443

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: Added O.z_impact_min.

2013-10-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-442

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D_power.m: Now also handling Faraday
	rotation.

2013-10-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-441

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D_power.m: Copied changes in function
	below.

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: Now free electrons included
	always in refr_index_air agenda.

	* atmlab-2-1-441

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_mars_planettbox.m: A bit improved header.

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_venus_planettbox.m: Some mars stuff
	remained. Now seems to run OK.

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: Added basic data for Venus and
	Jupiter.

2013-10-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-440

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: Planet specific mass introduced
	(to get correct satellite velocities).

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_venus_planettbox.m: New. Complete but not
	tested.

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_mars_planettbox.m: Polishing.

2013-10-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-439

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_fascode.m: Basically reimplemented from
	scratch. This to allow inclusion of ionospheric data from IRI and
	IGRF. Completed, but more testing would be good ...

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (cfile_AtmSrf): Started to include
	vmr_zeropadding but realised that it should not help me now.
	But present changes make this addition simple in the future.

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: Several smaller fixes. Introduced
	a reference point for t.

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D_power.m: A second version, also
	covering attenuation quantities (but much slower).

2013-10-10  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-438

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Fixed bug for A_SATLON atts.

2013-10-10  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-437

	* collocations/Collapser.m(fields_needed_for_dependency):

	- Added note that this method is insufficient in certain conditions.
	Started code to take care of those, but commented it out as it's not
	done yet.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m(read):

	- Clarified in documentation that, when output is being merged,
	information from the secondary (core or associated) may be
	meaningless.

	* sensors/atovs/atovs_read_data.m:

	- Added possibility to read satellite latitude, longitude, elevation.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Add satlat, satlon to assocated_gras_amsua

	- Started to get capsed lat2/lon2 for gras_amsua closest.  Remains
	unfinished and commented out.

2013-10-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-436

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_mars_planettbox.m: Updated to Jana's
	changes in ARTS. Extended to handle grid cropping and winds.
	Should be ready. Tested to work with the function below.

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: An initial Q can
	now be set.

2013-10-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-435

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: R.defocus was still initiated to
	NaNs. Now field removed. Field l_proppath introduced.

2013-10-04  Jana Mendrok  <jana.mendrok@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-434

	* h2o/parametrisations/eps_water_liebe93.m:
	Changed lower temperature limit to 248K. Introduced a flag to allow
	lower temperatures (but using eps(T=248K) for all eps(T<248K)). This as
	workaround (original liebe seriously degenerates, such that even
	constant eps assumptions seems much more reasonable) needed in ESA
	planet study to calculate sulfuric acid	solution epsilon.

	* scattering/mie_arts_scat_data.m: Minor spellfix.

2013-10-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-433

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_mars_planettbox.m: A first working version.

2013-10-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-432

	* Quick commit as missed to do svn add on new files.

	* geodetic/ellipsoidmodels.m: Added SphericalVenus, SphericalMars
	and SphericalJupiter.

	* atmlab-2-1-431

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_mars_planettbox.m: Just started.

	* Somewhat changed strategy for the "atmospheric include" system.
	ABS_SPECIES now set by the atmfunc. Also LAT/LON_GRID are set by
	the function. Introduced features to fine-adjust P/LAT/LON_GRID.

	* arts_usage/arts_radioocc_1D.m: Extended name of function, for
	better clarity. Adopted to changes in function below.

	* arts_usage/qarts_add_fascode.m: Added q to the name, to be
	consistent with the naming pattern that functions just modifying Q
	start with qarts. Changed as described above.

2013-10-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-430

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m (atmlab_init): Added arts_usage. Commented
	out the arts/scenegen folders as the stuff is not working.

	* h2o/parametrisations/complex_refr_indexFromFunc.m: Moved to this
	folder, from the arts folder. And improved spelling in header.

	* arts_usage/arts_ro_1D.m: Moved to this new folder.
	* arts_usage/arts_include_fascode.m:

	* arts_usage/Contents.m: New folder. The idea is to place more
	"high level" stuff here, and reserve the arts folder for core
	functions. (The scenegen stuff should be placed here, but better
	"hidden" in its present place until the system is updated).

	* arts/Contents.m: Updated.

2013-10-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-429

	* arts/arts_ro_1D.m: A typo made that T.l_geomtric was filled
	instead of T.l_geometric.

2013-10-01  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-428

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Bugfix in collapser for CLOSEST, it should properly consider flagged
	data resulting in nans.

2013-10-01  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-427

	* arts/arts_ro_1D.m (arts_ro_1D): Defocusing calculation could
	crash for point it= 1 and nt.

2013-10-01  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-426

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m(store):

	- Bugfix in flagging data. Was flagging too much in case of
	multi-channel instruments, and was causing complete failure in case of
	a very low number of collocs.

2013-09-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-425

	* arts/arts_ro_1D.m (arts_ro_1D): Defocusing now calculated
	on time sampled data. Much more stable results.

2013-09-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-424

	* arts/arts_ro_1D.m: Now also returning time sampled data.
	Defocusing results very unstable (for both R and T) and a fix is
	needed. Otherwise it looks good.

2013-09-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-423

	* arts/arts_ro_1D.m: Started on part providing time sampled data.
	Not ready!

2013-09-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-422

	* arts/arts_ro_1D.m: A basic version is ready.

	* arts/arts_include_fascode.m: Wrote header.

	* physics/constants.m: Added GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT and
	EARTH_MASS.
	(A fun coincidence here. For the gravitational constant, I first
	put in the value from Wikipedia. 30 min later I read Ny teknik
	from this week, and found out that a new measurement just has been
	published, 0.02% higher. I selected the new one. For link to
	abstract, see the file. Or see http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/353215/description/Notorious_Big_G_gets_a_little_larger).

	* atmlab-2-1-419

	* arts/arts_ro_1D.m: Just a start ...

2013-09-26  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-418

	- BREAKING BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY!  From now on, in the Collapser, the
	processor function handles must take TWO arguments.  The first one is
	the data to be collapsed, while the second one is the core.  Of course
	the second one need not be used, but it is passed on so it should be
	ignored if not used.

	* collocations/Collapser.m:

	- Adapt documentation and call to proccers{k}{pi} for the new
	processor methodology

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m(store):

	- Bugfix in concatenating structures, make sure it's the newest one
	that gets stored if the user explicitly passes something on.  Also add
	my e-mail as a default contact.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Adapt all listed processors for the aforementioned change
	- Add amsua CLOSEST for  use in gras-amsua

2013-09-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-416

	* graphs/new_figure.m: New. Useful if you want your new figures to
	be appended instead of put in first free slot, which is the option
	of the standard figure function.

	* scattering/mie_arts_scat_data.m: Changed 'size' to 'radius' in
	header text for r, for extra clarity.

2013-08-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-415

	(collocate):

	- Expand docs

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m:

	- Odc-By v1.0 license by default

2013-08-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-409

	new input argument do_fortran to include this check in the run.

	* scattering/tmatrix.m: Had to introduce a temporary variable when
	converting char input to cellstr. Worked on another matlab
	version!!!

2013-08-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-407

	* scattering/tmatrix.m: An interface towards ARTS to obtain

	model which literature has shown to agree with the average
	characteristics of the melting layer for logterm observation is
	described as a two phase mixture of ice-air (dry snow) and water.
	This model first calculates dry snow (ice inclusions in an air
	matrix) and a second time to mix dry snow and water (water
	inclusion in a dry snow matrix environment).

	- Shorted the code a bit by removing from repetitiveness

	* handy/PersistentCachedData.m: Out put a message telling the user
	how long ago the cached datafile was created

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m:  Account for the added space needed
	between the title and the underlynig pdf's

	* geoplots/gmt/separate_integer_and_unit.m: Fixed regular expression

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: fixed small bug

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: made title a bit smaller

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Fixed a never-trigged bug. Made the
	default legend orientation horisontal if you want to save the
	legend to a separate file

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Changed the name of some
	of my datasets

	* time/daterange.m: Added capability to deal with 2 element dates
	([yr,mn])

	* math/land_sea_mask.m: Fixed broken function due to external changes

	* geographical/ungridded2gridded.m
	* math/binned_statistics.m:
	Using opt.dataClass='some class' the user can make sure that all
	the data in the cells have the same class.  This is essential if
	you are later planning on doing a cell2mat on this output.

2013-08-08  Maryam Jamali  <maryamj@feldspar.rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-398

	* scattering/Bruggeman_mix_rule.m: New. Afunction to calculate
	refractive index by a mixing rule.

2013-08-08  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-395

	* datasets/SatDataset.m(read_granule):

	- Point out what units the always-returned stuff is in.  In
	particular, that 'time' is in seconds since 'epoch'.  Pointed out by
	Ajil that this was dangerously undocumented.

	* math/binned_statistics.m:

	- Enhance documentation, what in/out args the filter expects
	- Fix a bug in the usage of the filter (was unconditionally failing,
	nobody ever used this?!)

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:
	
	(collocate_granule):

	- Disable locking

	(collocate_and_store_date):

	- Throw error if overwrite=2 for CollocatedDataset, this is
	meaningless, only meaningful for AssociatedDatasets.  Will only
	confuse upon writing, actually resulting in confusing errors later on.

	(read):

	- After popular request (;-), indicate how many collocations are being
	read in the process.

	* sensors/atovs/zamsu2l1c.sh:

	- set GFORTRAN_STDIN_UNIT=5 GFORTRAN_STDOUT_UNIT=6
	GFORTRAN_STDERR_UNIT=0.  Change actually by Oliver.  Needed to read
	metop-b with AAPP7.  Don't aks me why please.

2013-08-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-394

	* demos/qpack2_demo2.m: Slightly extended to have a demo case
	operating with STOKES_DIM > 1.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.m (qp2_y2Q): Removed demand that
	size(Q.TNOISE_C,1) == length(Y(m).F). Not true if several
	polarisations measured.

2013-08-01  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-393

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m(collocate_granule):

	- Catch the new "catch-all" error identifier

	* sensors/read_saphir_l1.m:

	- Read either l1a or l1a2.  Should be passed by 3rd argument 'mode'.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m, site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Add saphir l1a2, and use it for collocated saphir.  Also add
	missing_value.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m(read_granule):

	- Set version info from filename if possible and not already set by
	reader or reader-processor

	* datasets/+satreaders/saphir.m:

	- Also rotate IncidencAngle


2013-07-23  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-392

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Fixed an old lying error message

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_inputs.m: Corrected an input test

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: Changed pdflatex call option from
	-interaction batchmode to -interaction nonstopmode to make sure
	that the whole output message is passed to exec_system_cmd if
	there is an error

2013-07-19  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-391

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m(collocate):

	- Permit situation where primary or secondary has only one
	measurement.

	* sensors/atovs/atovs_get_l1c.m:

	- When replacing one error by another, add the original one to the
	cause field, so that no information is lost.

	* sensors/atovs/atovs_read_data.m:

	- Only add elevation if available.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:

	- New option: 'force_nlevels'.  Until now, gmt always reduced nlevels
	to the number of unique values.  This is not always desirable, so it
	is now possible to switch this behaviour off by setting this flag to
	true.

	- In several places, replace hardcoded logtext(1, ...) by
	logtext(atmlab('OUT'), ...).  Also replaced some fprintfs by
	logtexts.

	(rmNaNsGeo_and_standardize_geodata):

	- Amended log message.  Was "dodgy geodata will be ignored (99%)",
	changed this to "dodgy geodata will be ignored (1%)", as this is what
	actually happened.

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: 

	- Here too some fprintf/logtext changes.

	* handy/getfields.m:

	- Permit to pass all fields as a single cellstr

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m:

	(pos2re): New re, permit letters in version

	* datasets/SatDataset.m(find_granule_covering_instant):

	- New method.  For a particular instant, return granule that should
	contain data for this moment.

	(find_granule_first_line):

	- Consider errid 'atmlab:SatDataset:cannotread'.

	- Adapt for situation where reading routine actually has nans in
	positions and times (happens with modis L2).

	* datasets/MaskInvalidGeoTimedataWithNaN.m:

	- Changed lying logging message to speak the truth.

	* datasets/+satreaders/grasdir.m:

	- Sensibly handle case with no data.

	* datasets/+satreaders/poes_radiometer.m:

	- Handle case with or without elevation

2013-07-11  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-390

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m, geoplots/gmt/gmt_inputs.m:

	- Changed behaviour for in.savelegend in order to behave as specified
	by the documentation.  Documentation said, "If you want to have a
	separate pdf for the legend".  Behaviour was to store only the legend,
	i.e. the actual map was lost!  New behaviour is to store both.
	Additionally, the old behaviour was to still have the legend in BOTH
	the file containing the map AND in a separate file.  Now one can set
	in.savelegend==2 to make sure that, if you store the legend to a
	separate file, it will not also be stored to the file containing the
	map.  I'm not sure why would anyone would want that, but if one does,
	in.savelegend==1 still does that.

	- Changed hardcoded name for legend from 'legend' to [in.filename
	'_legend'].

2013-07-02  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-389

	* geodetic/r_crossing.m:

	- Vectorised

	* geodetic/cartposlos2geocentric.m:

	- Pre-allocate vector.  It should be vectorisable but for now this
	factor-20 speedup is sufficient for me

	* geodetic/geocentricposlos2cart.m:

	- Save memory by clearing variables as soon as they're no longer
	needed.

	* collocations/FieldCopier.m(process_granule):

	- Cleanup some old, commented out workaround no longer needed

	- There are some cases where sibling datasets, all from CloudSat, have
	numerically inequal but still very close latitude fields.  Allow some
	margin in lat-differences before complaining latitude-fields are
	inconsistent.

	* collocations/Collapser.m(process_granule):

	- Bugfix if no. of uniques is very small in vectorised case (use
	size(...) instead of length(...))

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(collocate_granule):

	- Bugfix, properly set cols structure

	(collocate_and_store_date):

	- Fix the logic in the circumstances under which to redo all because
	the main is redone.

	* sensors/atovs/atovs_read_data.m,
	datasets/+satreaders/poes_radiometer.m:

	- Also read satellite elevation

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Added saa, sza, and satellite elevation, for amsua.

2013-06-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-388

	* demos/qarts_zeeman_demo.m: Zeeman calcualtions now activated.
	Finished header info.

2013-06-26  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-387

	* WARNING! Error identifier changed in SatDataset.read_granule.  See
	below!

	* collocations/Collapser.m:

	(merge_matrix): changed flags, should be accessible from other classes

	(process_granule):

	- Bugfix in vectorised collapsing when core is empty
	- Be a little bit more verbose in vectorised collapsing
	- Set self.cols appropiately in vectorised collapsing

	(redo_all):

	- New protected method, overloaded from AssociatedDataset.  See
	description there.  Here, returns true if version that collapsed data
	were generated with is from before 2-1-337.

	* collocations/FieldCopier.m:

	(needs_data):

	- Bugfix when not 'all' fields are asked for appending and some have
	'realname' members.

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m:

	(merge_matrix): 
	
	- changed flags (see note at Collapser)

	(process_delayed):

	- catch the situation where the secondary could not be read, even
	though it was read at the time of the original collocations.
	Unfortunately, this happens from time to time.  Generate a special
	exception for this case, and add the original as a 'cause'.  This
	permits the parent to catch this particular case, and perhaps redo
	collocations for the entire day (which is probably needed :().

	(redo_all):

	- New protected method.  To be overloaded by subclasses.  If there is
	a change that makes appending impossible, this one can return 'true'
	so that instead, everything is over-written.

	* collocations/FieldMultiInstrumentCopier.m:

	(process_granule):

	- Bugfix in situation where 'all' fields were processed

	- Bugfix in situation where some fields had 'realname' members

	- Bugfix related to collection of cols-structures

	* collocations/AssociatedPOESPlusCPR.m:

	(dynamically_get_members):

	- Remind myself to improve this one.  It's extremely slow because it's
	called very many times!

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(collocate_granule):

	- Add new 'atmlab:SatDataset:cannotread' identifier when trying to
	read secondary granule (see note at SatDataset(read_granule).

	- Implement locking mechanism using get_lock around most
	memory-intensive part... I might remove it again though

	- Clear big variables when no longer needed to save memory

	- Also collect cols, as not all fields may be asked nowadays

	(collocate_and_store_date):

	- Use AssociatedDataset.redo_all to check if I should redo all fields,
	e.g. due to changed algorithms or so, see note at (redo_all) above.

	- When primary is overwritten, also overwrite all associateds

	- When some fields are processed, some are read, do the processing
	first so all can be read at once

	(collocate_and_store_date_range):

	- If I occur the case where I could previosuly read a file, but not
	anymore, redo collocations for the entire day (communicated via
	errorid atmlab:AssociatedDataset:cannolongerread).

	(fill_addi):

	- Private method.  Move some of the collocate_and_store_date
	functionality here because I need to call it in two different cases.

	* atmlab/atmlab_version.m:

	- Expanded.  When 3 output arguments, return major, minor, micro as
	numbers, rather than as a single string.  Useful for checking version
	numbers.

	* files/get_lock.m:
	
	- Added.  Creates lockfile if possible, otherwise waits until it's
	possible.  Uses moving to minimise/prevent race conditions.  Thanks
	Oliver for the algorithm idea.

	* files/quickly_read_gzipped_netcdf_header.m:

	- Also return global attributes

	* files/create_tmpfolder.m:

	- Added note in documentation to use onCleanup

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Added modis_L3

	* handy/logtext.m:

	- When used inside parallel toolbox, also add task-id.  Does not
	affect people without the toolbox.

	- When called from a SatDataset method, also output the class and the
	object 'name'.

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m:

	- Use a sans-serif font for the title.  This should be the default.

	* handy/exec_system_cmd.m:

	- In case of an error, tell user what the command was that caused the
	error.

	* handy/cached_evaluation.m:

	- Small wrapper around CachedData.evaluate to prevent the need to
	create a CachedData object and stick it around somewhere persistent

	* handy/CachedData.m:

	- added evaluate to documentation method list

	* handy/sanitise.m:

	- Add '$' character to dangerous character list

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m:

	- Added 'version' member that can be used for various purposes

	(store):

	- Not sure when NetCDF library raises
	MATLAB:netcdf:defDim:nameIsAlreadyInUse and when
	MATLAB:imagesci:netcdf:libraryFailure.  Just catch both.

	- Be a little bit more verbose if wrongyl sized data is being stored.

	(granule_first_line):

	- Always return 1, eliminating need for databases for homemade
	datasets, that anyway never should have duplicates.

	(repvars):

	- Compared to parent, also replace $VERSION.  See also note at
	SatDataset(repvars).

	(infofit):

	- Compared to parent, also check is.version.  See also note at
	SatDataset(infofit).

	(pos2re):

	- Also consider $VERSION

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	- Expand documentation a little bit

	(find_datadir_by_date):

	- Be a little bit more informative if no basedir initialised

	- Use self.repvars, supersedes stringrep_variables

	(find_granules_by_date):

	- Use self.repvars, supersedes stringrep_variables

	- Move find_info_from_granule matching to new method infofit (see
	below)

	(find_granule_by_datetime):

	- Allow to pass datevecs less than 5 elems (i.e. for
	one-granule-per-day sets)

	- Use self.repvars, supersedes stringrep_variables, see below

	(read_granule):

	- CHANGED ERROR IDENTIFIER!  Now, catches any errors happening during
	reading, add those errors as the cause to a new exception, that is
	raised with err-identifier 'atmlab:SatDataset:cannotread'.  Then,
	callers can catch all reading-related errors at once and don't rely on
	catching different error-ids based on hdf-library, netcdf-library,
	etc.  This information is still available via the 'cause' member in
	the generated MException.

	(level3):

	- Take custom gridsize
	- use bin_nd instead of binning_fast therefore killing custom
	gridsize; in other words, method still work in progress

	(repvars):

	- New method, replaces strrep_variables.  This one can be overloaded
	by subclasses that want more vars than the standard ones to be
	replaced; for example, HomemadeDatasets also replace $VERSION.

	(infofit):

	- New method, replaces functionality previously coded inside
	find_granules_by_date.  Matches the output of find_info_from_granule
	to meta-information.  Can be subclassed for more specific matching,
	such as HomemadeDataset, which also looks at version.

	* datasets/strrep_variables.m:

	- Added deprecation note in documentation.

	* datasets/CollocatedMicrowaveOnlyIWP.m:

	- No longer hardcode version here, this is now in HomemadeDataset.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Added modis_L3 (no reader yet)

	- Changed more collapsers to be vectorised

	- Added G_PRESSURE to GRAS

2013-06-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-386

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.tex: Adopted and extended to new features.

	* demos/qpack2_wind3d_demo.m: Settings improved.

2013-06-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-385

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.m: Started on allowing 3D observation
	geometry.

	* arts/qarts_hse.m: Did just work for 1D. Z was set to result for
	last ilat/ilon combination.

	* demos/qpack2_wind3d_demo.m: Extended. Now operating in 3D.

2013-06-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-384

	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: Y.F now kept.

	* demos/qpack2_wind3d_demo.m: Just started.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.m: Started on extension, to handle
	multiple spectra observations. Y.F is now required to e set.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qp2_y.m: Added field AA. New text to describe
	size demands for ZA, Z_PLATFORM, AA and T_NOISE when measurement
	consist of several spectra.

2013-06-24  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-383

	* files/loadncvar.m:

	- Fixed extremely dangerous bug where all unidentified errors were
	silently ignored.  Please, when cathing an error and conditionally
	doing something, PLEASE add 'else, ME.rethrow()' to prevent errors
	from being silently ignored!

2013-06-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-382

	* sensors/amsua_apply_polarisation.m: New function.

2013-06-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-381

	* tests/make_check_qarts.m (make_check_qarts): For arts_oem_demo,
	now just demanding no error. The convergence can occasionally be
	poor and then a cost below 1.2 is not reached.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.tex: Updated with respect to changes
	below.

	* arts/qarts.m: Typo and spelling fixes. Added ATMDATA to
	WIND_U/V/W.

	* demos/qarts_zeeman_demo.m: Now also magnetic field set. Not
	ready, Zeeman still not active.

	* gformat/gf_artsxml.m: Added handling of mag and wind fields.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.m: Changes around ATMDATA. This field is
	now not required for ABS_SPECIES and T, if VMR_FIELD or T_FIELD
	is set, respectively. Added handling of ATMDATA for MAG and WIND
	quantities. In all cases, if ATMDATA is set, the corresponding
	FIELD is overwritten. For example, if T.ATMDATA is set, any
	setting of T_FIELD will be replaced.

	* arts/qarts_atm_field.m: Corrected header text. And %c changed to
	%s when creating astr.

	* demos/qpack2_demo2.m: Had to increase max of MINMAX for H2O. Old
	value was too low, but had no effect due to bug commented below.

	* arts/arts_oem_init.m: Gathered all input checks at start of
	function, to make good use of STRICT_ASSERT and make code below
	less messy. Improved check of wind fields. Extended header to make
	clear that the function does NOT consider ATMDATA. Max value of
	MINMAX was not applied due to a typo.

2013-06-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-380

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.m: Had missed to add ... when breaking a
	line.

2013-06-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-379

	* arts/qarts.m (qarts): Commited with a typo causing error.
	And added missing empty line for I of T.

2013-06-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-378

	* Started some work but got stuck when noticing inconsistency in
	how ATMDATA is used. Some thinking needed before attacking this ...

	* arts/qarts.m: Just introduced MAG_U, MAG_V and MAG_W.

2013-06-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-377

	* demos/data/line118ghz.hit: A linefile based in HITRAN2008.

	* demos/qarts_zeeman_demo.m: Still not working ... Seems to be a
	problem in arts.

2013-06-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-376

	* demos/qarts_zeeman_demo.m (qarts_zeeman_demo): Started.

	* arts/qarts_abstable.m: Spelling mistake in header.

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Added handling of ABS_XSEC_AGENDA and
	PROPMAT_CLEARSKY_AGENDA.
	Changed sub-function where blackbody_radiation_agenda is set.
	Removed some repeated call of Checked-methods.

	* arts/qarts.m: More strict alphabetical ordering. Added fields
	ABS_XSEC_AGENDA and PROPMAT_CLEARSKY_AGENDA.

	* demos/arts_oem_demo.m: Did not work due to some more recent arts
	changes. Increased max iterations to ensure that convergence
	always reached.

	* tests/make_check_qarts.m (make_check_qarts): Renamed make_check,
	to stress that only the qarts part is considered. Now running of
	several more demos included.

2013-06-18  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-375

	* handy/catstruct.m: fixed bug.
	vargin = cell(length(structs_index),1); should be vargin = cell(sum(structs_index),1);

2013-06-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-374

	* demos/qpack2_demo2.m: A version of qpack2_demo, including
	tropospheric attenuation.

	* gformat/atmdata_empty.m: Name of function wrong in header.

	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: Header slightly extended.

	* arts/arts_oem_init.m (arts_oem_init): Improved error message
	for check of MINMAX datatype.

2013-06-17  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-373

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: Added option pdfcrop (default=false) if
	you want to crop the output pdf. Works only if pdfcrop is
	installed

2013-06-16  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-372

	* math/binned_statistics.m: in.replace, (to put in place of empty
	cells) may be a cell so that you can have different "replace"
	values per input function. E.g., for @(x)(hist(x(x>=0),0:10)) I
	wanted to relace empty cells with "zeros(1,11)" since the output
	is a vector, but for @(x)(size(x,1)), I want to replace them by
	"0" since the output is a scalar.

	* geographical/ungridded2gridded.m:
	- Adapted for new in.replace.

	- Added a cautionary note about blindly using @(x)(x>0) as a
	filter if you are expecting a matrix output. Default is now to not
	filter the data in this way. I see that no other codes in atmlab
	are using this function right now. I feels dangerous to do have a
	filter by default, so the default filter is now ''.

	- Now only converts the binned data to double if it has to, or is
	it is asked to (if opt.ensureDouble = true)

2013-06-13  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-371

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: Added extra tweak option
	"rightPadding". It does padding to the right of a row. Right now
	it needs one value per row. e.g., for 4 rows something like
	options.rightPadding=[1.7,1.7,0,0]. default is for this to not be
	set at all. Could be implemented nicer, but I was in a rush.

	* handy/catstruct.m: Fixed an error message

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_inputs.m: in.extra_legend can now also be set
	to false if you don't want it. Normally this legend is used to
	display the color of NaNs

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Fixed typo. Fixed so that daterange
          doesn't get confused by -inf

2013-06-13  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-370

	* collocations/Collapser.m:

	(vectorised):

	- New property, defaults to 'false'.  If set to true, then the
	processors, global limitators, and local limitators, operate on
	vectorised input with nans.  This can speed up processing by a
	factor 100 to 1000, but reduces flexibility and requires rewrites.
	Therefore, despite the huge speed increase, it is by default disabled.

	(fieldstruct), (overall_limitators):

	- Adapt documentation based on new vectorised technique.

	(process_granule):

	- Expanded.  Can now handle either unvectorised or vectorised
	processing.  Solution for vectorised processing is rather
	sophisticated and likely contains bugs.  See new documentation and
	code for details.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Add collocation_mhs_avhrr.  The data are so huge, I won't be storing
	it.  Also added fieldcopier and collapser.  The collapser works in a
	vectorised way.

2013-06-11  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-369

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(read):

	- Be more verbose when reading additionals

	(collocate_and_store_date_range):

	- Bugfix, also get duplicate-db (granule_first_line) for previous
	day, because last granule there is read.  Prevent infinite loop.

	(meet_dependencies):

	- Bugfix, at the risk of introducing a new bug, do not wrongly
	complain that certain fields are missing if they aren't to be
	processed.  Simply add all dependencies to the reading and if the
	reading fails, I'll find out later.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- For amsua, get rid of limitator, because sometimes, only some
	channels, not all, are flagged.  Also take care of this situation when
	calculating the average and so.  Involves new subfunction ignoreNeG.

	(ignoreNeG): Like ignoreNaN but ignoring negative values (flagged)

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Fix subdir for collapsed_gras_amsua (was set to basedir)

2013-06-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-368

	* gformat/atmdata_regrid.m (atmdata_regrid): Removed %&%-markers.

	* arts/arts_regrid.m: LAT_TRUE was used for 2D. Changed to
	LAT_GRID. This function works only for switching between basic
	grids, ie. LAT_TRUE and LON_TRUE should not be considered/used.
	Bug found by Ole Martin.

	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: Fixed two spelling errors in comments.

2013-06-10  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-367

	* datasets/define_datasets.m: Added cloudPhase field to a fieldcopier

	* datasets/SatDataset.m: Slight fix to if statement to avoid an
	unnecessary error

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m: Very slight edit to avoid a
	warning produced using vec2col

	* graphs/scatter_density_plot.m: Changed the article reference in
	the header

2013-06-08  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-366

	* geographical/ungridded2gridded.m: Put in some assertions to make
	sure the requested grid is correct and fixed a bug in setting the
	size of the grids.

2013-06-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-365

	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: Now abs_f_interp_order defined if wind
	retrieval, required due to change in arts.

2013-06-05  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-364

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(verify_addis):

	- More informative error message

	(fix_dependencies):

	- Bugfix in error message generation

	* sensors/atovs/atovs_define_amsubl1c.m:

	- Added reference to docs in comment to reduce change of ambiguity

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m(store):

	- Check correct sizes, and if not found, give a helpful, informative
	error message.

2013-06-05  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-363

	* demos/qarts_scattering_demo.m: FOS was in an intermediate state.
	Now error if trying to use FOS.

2013-06-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-362

	* arts/qarts.m: Text for WSMS_AT_START was incorrect. Correct is
	that INCLUDES is called before WSMS_AT_START.

	* gformat/gf_empty.m: Adopted new assert expression, dim is
	allowed to be 0.

	* arts/qarts_abstable.m: Header text for optional arguments
	corrected and improved. Default for dt is now 1, the old of value
	of 3 is not a good one.

2013-06-03  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-361

	* collocations/Collapser.m:

	(process_granule):

	- for the classical collocation situation (all or nothing), give
	deps_cols and memnames sensible defaults and make no. of arguments
	optional

	* collocations/FieldCopier.m:

	- add a private property oldlocalcols for internal use

	(process_granule):

	- for the classical collocation situation (all or nothing), give
	fields a sensible default and handle this properly.  When reading
	a sibling failed, try to guess the width for the fields based on
	either previous experience, but preferably on a dims-field.  Will
	give a warning if neither are found.  Use oldlocalcols to communicate
	between subsequent calls.

	(needs_data):

	- Use 'realname' fields to determine if reading or not

	* collocations/FieldMultiInstrumentCopier.m:

	(needs_primary_data) (needs_secondary_data):

	- Handle properly the case where 'all' fields are requested.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(collocate_granule):
	
	- Small addition to comments

	(collocate_and_store_date):

	- Fix allocation of addisread, addisprocess, addishas.  Properly keep
	track of localcols (don't remember why exactly the change I did here).

	(read):

	- Be a little more verbose when reading from cache

	(deal_fields):

	- small fix

	(fix_dependencies):

	- Revert to old default if new argument not given

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m:

	(store):

	- Tell user how many collocs are written

	* datasets/dsmagic.m:

	- Properly relay isfield

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Expand valid_range for A_BT.  Probably in error and actually a bug
	somewhere.

2013-05-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-360

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Merged my and Salomon's text for STRICT_ASSERT.

	* arts/arts_abstable.m: Added check that target output file
	generated, to provide a proper error message.

2013-05-31  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-359

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Added description about the new option
	(STRICT_ASSERT) in atmlab

	* geophysics/z2p_cira86.m: Use atmlab('STRICT_ASSERT') to skip the
	assertions.

	* gformat/gf_artsxml.m
	* gformat/gf_set_grid.m:
	* gformat/atmdata_regrid.m:
	* gformat/gf_regrid.m:
	* math/gridinterp.m:
	Put atmlab('STRICT_ASSERT') around assertions.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.m:
	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: 
	Added some error identifiers and
	changed some & to &&, | to ||, and some length(x)>0 to ~isempty(x)
	to speed things up (probably slightly).

	* gformat/gf_empty.m:
	changed:
	rqre_alltypes( dim, {@istensor0,@iswhole} );
	rqre_in_range( dim, 0 );

	to

	assert(isnumeric(dim) && isscalar(dim) &&  all( dim - round(dim) == 0 )&& dim>0,...
	 errid,'*dim* did not pass the test: @istensor0 && @iswhole')

	since it's the same and tic, toc says it's 1000x faster


2013-05-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-358

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (cfile_AtmSrf): Added handling of
	VMR_NEGATIVE_OK.

	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: Min values defined for O3 retrieval.
	Comment around Q.VMR_NEGATIVE_OK added.

	* arts/arts_x2QR.m: R.minmax applied here.

	* arts/arts_oem_init.m: Now setting up a variable, R.minmax, that
	reflects ABS_SPECIES and T MINMAX, and allows that MINMAX is
	introduced also for other quantities.

	* arts/qarts.m: Added ABS_SPECIES.MINMAX, T.MINMAX and
	VMR_NEGATIVE_OK.

2013-05-31  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-357

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Added STRICT_ASSERT in one place.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.m: Now using STRICT_ASSERT.

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Added STRICT_ASSERT. Will maybe be renamed.
	More information later. Updated text for WORK_AREA.

2013-05-30  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-356

	* datasets/+satreaders/grasdir.m:

	- Fix dimensions, add version (unknown).

	* datasets/define_datasets.m, site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Added material for gras-amsua collocations

	* datasets/+satreaders/netcdf_dataset.m:

	- Adapt to changed behaviour in loadncvar

2013-05-29  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-355

	* gformat/gf_set_grid.m: Since this function may be called very
	many times, I sped this function up by a factor 2-3 by using
	assertions directly instead of the rqre_* functions

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: Exchanged all the %f's with %g since there
	is no need to truncate values and the loss of precision was
	causing problems.

2013-05-27  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-354

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: Fixed bad regular expression

2013-05-27  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-353

	* geoplots/gmt/psscale.m: exchanged %.0f with %g, because it's
	useless if I can't have tickspacing less than 1

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: got rid of needless assertion for vspace and hspace to be > 0

2013-05-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-352

	* geophysics/z2p_cira86.m:

	Slight tweak. Allow empty Gc86z and Gc86t input to allow same call
	signature on first and following calls:

	cz=[]; ct=[];
	[p,t,cz,ct]=z2p_cira86(     2000,80,100,cz,ct);
	[p,t,cz,ct]=z2p_cira86([1:1000]',45,100,cz,ct);

2013-05-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-351

	* geophysics/z2p_cira86.m:

	Optionally return the original cira86 z_field and t_field. If the user
	has to call this function very often, he can cache the cira86 data and
	pass it in on following calls. This avoids reading the xml files over
	and over again.

	[p,t,cz,ct]=z2p_cira86(1000,45,100);
	[p,t]      =z2p_cira86(2000,80,100,cz,ct); end

2013-05-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-350

	* math/istensor0.m: Speed up by factor 10 by using isscalar.

	* math/istensor1.m: Speed up by factor 3-11 depending on input data.

2013-05-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-349

	* arts/xml/xml*:

	strcat is evilly slow in Matlab. Replaced all occurrences with []
	concatenation. Let me know if this breaks anything for you.
	Thanks to Salomon for making me aware it!

	Some before/after benchmarks:

	GriddedField4:
	>> tic, for i = 1:100, x = xmlLoad('cira86.z.xml'); end; toc

2013-05-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-348

	* demos/qarts_demo2.m: Ah, warning added yeasterday works. DOY was
	given to qarts_atm_field, instead of MJD.

	* files/create_tmpfolder.m: Added a line removing whitespace from
	generated folder name. Needed as, for unknown reason, my user name
	now comes out with a leading space!

2013-05-23  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-347

	* arts/xml/xmlLoad.m: Added cobj = onCleanup(@()fclose(fid)); to
	make sure the fid is closed even if the code crashes later on

2013-05-22  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-346

	* datasets/+satreaders/grasdir.m: Added

	- Read full directory of GRAS occultations as if it were a single
	granule.  First version, work in progress but basics appear to work.

2013-05-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-345

	* Yes, there was a bug, but in a different way. atmdata_regrid
	takes only MJD is input date format (actually mentioned in
	header). The problem was that the cira86 functions sent in doy.
	Fixed and added a warning that hopefully shall catch bad usage in
	the future. (Discussed with Salomon before committing.)

	To be clear, the cira functions returned before data for doy-44.
	Sorry about that.

	* geophysics/z2p_cira86.m:
	* geophysics/p2z_cira86.m: MJD now sent to atmdata_regrid.m.

	* gformat/atmdata_regrid.m: Reverted Salomon's change. Added a
	warning, triggered if input days appear strange.

2013-05-22  Mathias Milz  <mathias.milz@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-344 

	* gridcreation/annealing/join_fast_f_grid.m: Added
	  join_fast_f_grid: Reads the f_grid from the individual channels
          which should be combined together with the annealing results of 
	  these channels and combines them to one long f_grid with the 
	  according weights in a sparse matrix

2013-05-22  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-343

	* gformat/atmdata_regrid.m: Fixed bug where dayofyear was being
	treated as a modified julian day. consequence of this is that the
	output from mjd2doy(doy) appears to be always doy-44, i.e. the day
	was silently shifted. I sent an email to atmlab_dev about this

	* time/mjd2doy.m: Make sure the input date is always double

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: small update

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Added another test and completely
	restructured function to make it easier to add new tests.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: - Rearranged order of subfunctions.
	Made some other changes to the defaults

	* datasets/define_datasets.m: explictly set types for cloud_cci
	fieldcopiers

	* datasets/dardarsub_postprocessor.m: Added narginck

	* datasets/cpr_postprocessor.m: Added some more documentation

	* geophysics/z2p_cira86.m: Added identifiers to the errors

	* collocations/Collapser.m: Use newfield.stored.(procname).type if
	it is defined, istead of just always using 'float'

2013-05-22  Mathias Milz  <mathias.milz@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-342

	* gridcreation/annealing/loop_anneal.m: updated documentation

	* gridcreation/annealing/apply_annealing.m: Added.
	  apply_annealing reads the required input from xml files (ARTS
          output), and uses the provided accuracy to initiate the loop to
          obtain the simulated annealing grid. The loop continues until the
          desired accuracy is reached. This run should be applied for each
          individual channel

2013-05-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-341

	* h2o/parametrisations/eps_water_liebe93.m: Removed alternative,
	inactive, internal version. Added comment explaining why result
	deviates slightly from epswater93.

2013-04-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-340

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Partly reverted last commit, following
	changes in arts.

2013-04-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-339

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Changed to use named version for GIN
	variables, for some WSM calls.

	(cfile_Absrpt): Added Ignore(rtp_pnd) to propmat_clearsky_agenda.

2013-04-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-338

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Added new folder.

	* gridcreation/uniformsphere: Added this folder, with a set of
	functions to generate points giving an uniform sampling of a
	sphere. The functions are taken from the Matlab central. See
	Contents.m.

2013-04-25	Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-337

	* New feature in collocation toolkit.  In addition to fully
	over-writing collocations (overwrite = 1) or skipping any cases where
	files already exist (overwrite = 0), one can can 'extend' any
	AssociatedDataset (at least FieldCopier, FieldMultiInstrumentCopier,
	Collapser, and their implementations).  In this case, ONLY fields that
	are not already in the resulting file will be processed.

	* WARNING — change in collapser can cause inconsistencies with
	previously collapsed data!  See below.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(collocate_and_store_date):

	- In additional to "do not overwrite" and "do overwrite", implement
	"extend", triggered by overwrite = 2.

	(collocate_and_store_date_range): Tiny change

	(read): Ignore unused deal_index

	(collocate):

	- Ignore unused lon_grid1

	- %#OK<AGROW> where I'm actually pre-allocating in a smart way.

	(deal_fields):

	- Pre-allocate cell array to shut up mlint.

	(fix_dependencies):

	- Adapt for new way of treating some fields only.  Takes an additional
	argument describing the columns, and returns an additional one
	describing the columns.

	(meet_dependencies):

	- For the various additional datasets, make sure at least the fields
	within dependencies are read therefrom.

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m:

	(primary_arguments) (secondary_arguments) (needs_primary_data)
	(needs_secondary_data): 

	- Changed abstract method signature.  Now implementations must accept
	an input 'fields'.

	(process_granule):

	- Changed abstract method signature.  Now implementations must accept
	additional inputs 'depcols', describing the columns in the
	dependencies, and 'fields', describing what fields are to be
	processed.  Implementations should also output a second argument,
	'localcols', describing the columns of the first one 'out'.

	(fields_needed_for_dependency): Added

	- New abstract method.  For a certain dependency, describe what fields
	are needed.

	(process_delayed):

	- Added two new inputs and one new output.  Since depies might no
	longer contain all fields, depcols now describes its columns.  The 2nd
	new input 'fields' instructs what fields to process.  The new output
	argument is a structure describing the columns of the 1st output.

	- Adapt for self.needs_primary_data, self.needs_secondary_data,
	self.primary_arguments, self.secondary_arguments, self.process_granule
	which all now take a 'fields' argument, and process_granule returns a
	localcols structure.
	
	* collocations/FieldCopier.m:

	(process_granule):

	- Improved.  Only process fields that are asked to be processed.

	(primary_arguments) (secondary_arguments) (needs_primary_data)
	(needs_secondary_data):

	- Adapt for new signature, consider what fields are to be processed.
	Uses private methods 'arguments' and 'needs_data', respectively.

	(fields_needed_for_dependency):

	- Dummy implementation; FieldCopiers have no dependencies on other
	AssociatedDatasets.

	* collocations/Collapser.m:

	(process_granule):

	- Improved.  Only process fields that are asked to be processed.  This
	is a major change and might introduce bugs.

	- Do not remove collapsed fields just because all values happen to be
	flagged; this causes problems if such is different for subsequent
	collapsers of other fields based on the same original.  Therefore,
	only remove if the global limitators say so.  THIS CAN CAUSE
	INCONSISTENCIES WITH PREVIOUSLY COLLAPSED DATA!

	- Be more verbose in saying what is to be collapsed.

	(primary_arguments) (secondary_arguments) (needs_primary_data)
	(needs_secondary_data):

	- Adapt for new signature (but still all N/A).

	(get_cols_from_bro) (set_cols_from_bro): Helpers for new localcols.

	* collocations/FieldMultiInstrumentCopier.m:

	- Improved class documentation a bit

	(primary_arguments) (secondary_arguments) (needs_primary_data)
	(needs_secondary_data):

	- Adapted to changed signature.  Mostly delegate everything to the
	'child' FieldCopiers.

	(process_granule):

	- Now handles selective fields, outputs localcols.  Mostly relies on
	changes in FieldCopier.

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m:

	(overwrite): Document new behaviour of property

	(store):

	- Implement new system of writing only some fields.  If
	self.overwrite=2, the netcdf file is opened for appending, it is not
	overwritten.  In this case, no global attributes are written (although
	they should, there's a FIXME).  Variables that are already there are
	also not written (this should be improved).

	(linesize):

	- When estimating linesize, consider localcols.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	(read_granule): Small doc improvement

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Adapt fields for associated_CPR_MHS_AMSU_HIRS and its collapser.
	No more profiles, but add liquid.  No more coefficienc of variation,
	change frac100 to frac40 to correspond to result in Eliasson et al.
	(2013).

	* files/quickly_read_gzipped_netcdf_header.m: Added

	- Risky little function that unpacks the first couple of kB for a
	NetCDF file and tries to read it in order to return a cell array of
	contained variables.  This allows te quickly look what names exist,
	without having to read a possibly huge file or even to gunzip it
	completely.  This is risky because premature truncation of a NetCDF
	header crashes Matlab completely.  Use at your own risk.Z

	* handy/safegetfield.m: Added

	- safegetfield(S, field, alt) returns S.(field) if field exists, alt
	otherwise.

	* handy/rqre_subset.m: Added

	- For two cell arrays, assert that one is a subset of the other.

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Deprecate.

2013-04-24  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-336

	* files/type_nc2ml.m: Added, convert from nc-type to matlab-type

2013-04-24  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-335

	* datasets/read_isccp.m:

	# Added generic ISCCP reading routine that can:

	- Read DX data (15km, 3rly) and output the results into a nice structure
	- Cannot not yet read the D1 dataset (250*250km,3hrly). Have put a
	placeholder for future implementation.
	- Can read the D2 dataset (250*250km, monthly mean). Currently the
	output format is in a legacy format and therefore doesn't match the
	function documentation (will be fixed when there is time).

	* datasets/+satreaders/isccp_dx.m:
	- updated to read read_isccp()

	* math/hist2d.m:

	- Added missing function. This function is called
	by scatter_density_plot but only existed locally on Gerrits and my
	computers.


2013-04-23  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-334

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Added avhrr_capsed

	- Added some more fields for CPR (progress in progress)

	(mem2fc): Prepare fc members field for a fc's input field

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Added associated_cacmah_avhrr and collapsed_cacmah_avhrr

	* handy/get_columns:

	- Expanded, now takes either cell array or structure

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m(store):

	- Bugfix: do not flag ALL data if some are invalid, only those that
	are invalid

	- Small wording change

	* datasets/+satreaders/avhrr.m:

	- Temporary solution for flag_3_is_3A.

	* math/column_integrate.m: Write to atmlab('OUT'), not to 1

	* collocations/Collapser.m:

	(process_granule):

	- When collapsing and it takes a long time, post some progress info
	every 10 minutes

	(read_homemade_granule):

	- Bugfixes, now correctly reading scalar and non-scalar fields

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m(process_delayed):

	- Keep user informed of progress

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m(deal_fields):

	- Change access permissions

	* files/uncompress.m: Bugfix (c -> cur)



2013-04-20  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-333

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:

	- Filename handling a bit smarter. Now looks for a suffix that
	indicates the type of file you want (e.g, pdf,jpg,png, etc), and
	will then create an output file in that format. If no suffix is
	present (or it's not a valid file type for gmt), then the output
	file is .pdf

	- supported figure types are: 'eps','pdf','BMP','jpg','PNG','PPM'
	(not recommended), or 'tif'

	- Added the fields:
	in.annot_font_size_primaty: sets the font size of primary annotations
	in.header_font: there are 35 fonts to choose from.

	- Changed the input type expected of a few variables.

	The fields: in.map_width,in.extra_legend.fontsize, and
	in.legend.{fontsize,length,width,xpos,ypos}, all changed their
	expected input from [%f] to [%s or %f]. The reason for this is
	increased flexibility. With a string, both the interger and unit
	are given
	(e.g. '17c'=17cm). Earlier the input %f was assumed to be a
	certain unit, often inches. If the input is %f, the globally set
	in.measure_unit is used for the unit

	- Renamed some fields.

	in.title => in.header
	in.headersize => in,header_font_size
	in.legend.annot_font_size_primary => in.legend.fontsize

	Some fields that have changed are still backwards compatible, some
	not. However, all input variables and fields are firstly checked
	to make sure they are the right type, and if not, the error
	message indicates what variable type is expected.

	- Much better default handling of the legends.

	- Restructured the help section so that it is easier to follow

	* geoplots/gmt/psscale.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_inputs.m :
	Adapted to new variable types.

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:

	- Added some more gmtdefaults.
	- Much improved handling of default legend options

	* geoplots/gmt/extra_legend.m:

	added error is mandatory input fields are missing

	* geoplots/gmt/separate_integer_and_unit.m:

	Added a little function that separates the integer and unit from a
	string. I use this a lot for options in gmt. e.g., '9i',
	'-23.534cm' gives [9,'i'], and [-23.534,'cm'] respectively. If
	the input is scalar, the unit is ''

	* geoplots/gmt/grdcontour.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/psbox.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/pslocations.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/pscoast.m:

	Small update for cleaner output

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m:

	Added a little extra room at the top of the pdf if you have a
	title

	* datasets/+satreaders/isccp_dx.m : Added reader satreader for isccp_dx

2013-04-19  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	(process_granule):

	- Add capability to correctly collapse profiles.  
	- Keep track of time to inform user how much progress is being made.

	(set_cols_from_bro): Added

	- For a collapsed dataset, derive cols-structure not from
	members-structure, but from the corresponding AssociatedDataset, so
	that users don't need to specify dimensions by hand.

	* collocations/FieldCopier.m(process_granule):

	- Flood the screen less when many sibling-fields are being read.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m(list_fields):

	- Added warning to documentation, informing on limitations

	* atmlab-2-1-331

	* demos/qarts_scattering_demo.m: Restart for FOS ...

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (cfile_Absrpt): The call of
	propmat_clearsky_agenda_checkedCalc now in this sub-function.

2013-04-19  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-330

	* datasets/dsmagic.m: Added

	- Looks like a structure, feels like a structure, but secretly
	communicates with datasets() so that it gets updated whenever a
	dataset is added.

	* datasets/datasets.m:

	- Use dsmagic, refactored code.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- No need to recall datasets() so often anymore.  Started work toward
	adding AVHRR to the collocations.  Still in progress.

	* documentation/collocations.tex:

	- Write a bit more about the FieldCopier capabilities

	* collocations/Collapser.m(process_granule):

	- Fixed bug when using missing_value for collapsed statistic

	* atmlab-2-1-329

	* demos/qarts_backend_demo.m (qarts_backend_demo): New.

	* h2o/thermodynamics/spechum2e.m: Function name was wrong in header.

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Replaced an ~ with a dummy variable (u) on
	output side. The ~ feature is quite new and can cause problems,
	such as for version 7.8 that I have on my laptop.

2013-04-17  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-328

	* collocations/Collapser.m(read_homemade_granule):

	- Added.  Calls self.parent.read, so now we can collocate collapsed
	datasets correctly.

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read.m:

	- Fix order of dimensions
	- Read header to determine no. scanlines

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read_raw.m:

	- Read header to determine no. scanlines

	* time/unixsecs2date.m:

	- Semi-revert previous edit.  Previous edit fixed one bug (loss of
	precision), but doesn't work for vectorised input.  Now check for
	vectorisation and choose based on that.

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Added avhrr and Collocated_cacmah_avhrr

	* handy/getfields.m: Added.  Get multiple fields from struct.

	- Added avhrr and cacmah_avhrr.  Rewrote subfunction getSelection.

2013-04-17  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-327

	* collocations/Collapser.m(process_granule):

	- Big speedup by simply caching some function calls outside the loop,
	even simple ones like ~isempty.  Now spends most of the time in
	essential parts.

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m(process_delayed):

	- Inform on how many segments are to be processed.

	* handy/flat.m: Helper to flatten array in-place

2013-04-17  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-326

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Added back the utf-8 characters

	* handy/PersistentCachedData.m: Added workaround alternative way
	to find the free disk space if you are on a Mac

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:
	Added Collapser: dardar_modis_cprLidar_closest

	* graphs/scatter_density_plot.m: bugfix: use paddedx and paddedy in plot_medians() call

2013-04-16  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-325

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read.m:

	(avhrr_gat_read):

	- Added documentation
	- Added capability to read arbitrary fields
	- Define epoch appropriately

	(calibrate_avhrr):

	- Adapt to data_line being scalar structure with vector members
	- Flag data if particular bits are set (bad calibration,
	geolocation...)

	(navigate_avhrr):

	- Added routine to 'navigate', that is get lat/lon per footprint.
	Uses spline interpolation "inspired" by IDL code from Nigel Atkinson.

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read_raw.m:

	- Check data integrity before proceeding to read binary data (quite
	basic check)

	- Vectorise reading by reading all data, then typecasting in a clever
	way.  Much faster (>factor 10) now.

	* sensors/atovs/unpack_bip.m:

	- Speedup by "caching" words.

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_define_gac_l1b.m:

	- Add 'cast_type' for new direct-casting usage

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read_data.m: Deleted, obsolete.

2013-04-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-324

	* demos/qarts_ppath_demo.m (qarts_ppath_demo): New.

	* demos/qarts_demo.m: Fixed comment typo.

2013-04-15  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-323

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_define_gac_l1b.m:

	- Moved code to calculate types and sizes for reading here, it needs
	to be done only once per field after all.

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read.m:

	(avhrr_gac_read.m):

	- Also read avh_sclintime and avh_pos
	- Call measurement 'y' because it's either Tb or albedo

	(calibrate_avhrr):

	- Add visible channels
	- Warn on negative radiances but don't crash on them, just set them to 0
	- More commenting

	(navigate_avhrr):

	- Started work on navigation part.  Unfinished.

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read_raw.m:

	- Various speedups, twice as fast now, mainly by moving things out of
	loops, and by replacing cellfun with explicit loop.  Should still be
	improvable (single file takes 30 seconds...).

2013-04-12  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-322

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read.m: Added

	- Major progress toward a reading routine for AVHRR GAC.  Current
	status: reading and calibrating the thermal channels appears to work.
	Geolocation and solar channels still to be done.

	* sensors/atovs/unpack_bip.m:

	- Added FIXME that this function should be vectorised.

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read_raw.m:

	- Change default behaviour.  By default, read all lines rather than
	none.

	* handy/c.m -> handy/cur.m, handy/p.m -> handy/par.m: Renamed.

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m(read_single_day):

	- Graciously handle dataless day

	* datasets/+satreaders/cpr.m:

	- Bugfix as to for what epochs we have version numbers.  This is a
	temporary solution until the reading routines are adapted.

	* handy/PersistentCachedData.m:

	- Actually convey some facts in the error message

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(read):

	- When verifying addi granule consistency, also pass date

	- Build a try/catch around the attempts to store a cache entry.  If I
	can't store a cache entry, simply go on and don't crash, as caching is
	a luxury anyway.

	(verify_addi_granule_consistency):

	- Take the date as an argument (was erroneously writing the current
	date in the error message).

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read_data.m: Nanochanges.


2013-04-11  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-321

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	- Fixed bug for horisontal legends.
	- ensure that the data input to the netcdf save is double
	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: Fixed bug in header_offset

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Removed utf-8 stuff because Mac can't handle it

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: forgot to have a default title (title='')

2013-04-11  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-320

	* collocations/Collapser.m: Added Gerrit's fixes that he did
	locally to not throw away valid footprints where one or some
	limiters return a missing value

	* geographical/ungridded2gridded.m:
	- More descriptive header.
	- Some more defaults.

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Added ISCCP dx dataset

	* datasets/cpr_postprocessor.m: Adapted for multiLayer cloud Types

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:
	- Added ISCCP datasets.
	- Added for more pseudo_fields for cpr and MODIS datasets
	- read iwp_error instead of cwp_uncertainty in cloud_cci - dardar
	fieldcopier
	- setup to read cloud_types_multilayer instead for
	modisdarar_cloudtypes collocated dataset.
	- Adapted multilayer cloud types product

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: Added capability to add a title and adjust
	its font size.

2013-04-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-319

	* lineshape/faddeeva/: Ignore *\.mex*64

2013-03-28  Richard Larsson  <ric.larsson@gmail.com>

	* atmlab-2-1-318

	* atmlab/atmlab_mex.m: Added

	This file is infrastructure for the compilation of non-matlab code. Assumes
	the user has set up their mex compiler themselves already.

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Changed

	Added path to the faddeeva function.

	* lineshape/faddeeva/*: New functionality

	Allows the user to call Faddeeva* functions. For mor information see the
	included README. This is exactly the same file and functionality that is
	included in ARTS presently.

2013-03-27  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-317

	* handy/p.m: Added

	- Function equivalent of parenthesis, allowing for more compact code

	* handy/c.m: Added

	- Function equivalent of curly braces, allowing for more compact code

	* graphs/fill_between.m: Added

	- Analogue to matplotlibs fill_between, for filling an area between
	two lines

	* graphs/zerowhite.m, graphs/zerowhite2.m: Small change

	- In documentation added "see also" pointing to zerowhite, zerowhite2,
	and zerobright.

	* graphs/sanepcolor.m: Added

	- From Matlab file exchange.  Like pcolor, but values relate to edges,
	not vertices.

	* graphs/drywet.m: Added

	- Colourmap ranging from field drab via white to midnight blue

	* graphs/zerobright.m: Added

	- Scale, stretch and centre colourmap so that the brightest colour,
	for example white, gets assigned to white.

	* graphs/save_figure_multi.m:

	- Added check if no figures are asked to be written at all.

	* collocations/Collapser.m(process_granule): Bugfix

	- Members-struct was "smartly" overwritten causing information on
	flags to be lost for collapsed fields.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m(collocate_and_store_date_range):

	- For some reason logtext(self.log) occasionally fails.  Comment out
	until I know why.

	* files/uncompress.m:

	- Added option to specify tool to uncompress with (shell or builtin).
	Defaults to old behaviour.

	* sensors/read_cloudsat_hdf.m:

	- Added try-catch in case uncompress fails, as sometimes it succeeds
	with the builtin tool even if it fails with 'unzip'.

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m(read_single_day):

	- Adapt error text if invalid data are found

	* datasets/SatDataset.m(read_granule):

	- Do not try to read/write cache if cache is not setup

	- Gracefully handle if data cannot be read due to shell-reported error

	* datasets/+satreaders/cpr.m:

	- Added workaround for missing attributes in E05/E06, set
	product_version to dummy

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Define missing_value for CV_ROIWP

2013-03-27  Ole Martin Christensen  <olem@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-316

	* gformat/gf_save.m: Added check for matlabversion and if version
	> 7.3 then save with the option '-v7.3' to accomodate files greater
	than 2 GB.

2013-03-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-315

	* atmlab/atmlab.m:

	Use system instead of exec_system_cmd. There are more risks to run
	into the recursion bug in the future. E.g. if the default verbosity
	of exec_system_cmd would be changed to 1 for some reason, the
	recursion would be triggered by exec_system_cmd's call to logtext.
	It also depends on atmlab().

	This function is so essential and at the core of atmlab that it should
	not call other atmlab functions itself.

	* handy/exec_system_cmd.m:

	Put back stuff I commented out in previous commit.

2013-03-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-314

	* handy/exec_system_cmd.m: Commented out previous change.

	exec_system_cmd must not call atmlab() because it is itself
	called by atmlab() -> booom!!!. Leads to endless recursion in
	startup.m. 

2013-03-26  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-313

	* datasets/cpr_postprocessor.m:
	- Cleaned up a little, and implemented a new behaviour with the
	cloud types

	* datasets/cloud_cci_postprocessor.m:
	- Updated for new field names

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m (combine_pdfs):
	- Added input option 'display'. If true it will try to open the
	final output .pdf-file

	* handy/exec_system_cmd.m:
	- Internally set atmlab('VERBOSITY') to
	verbose (2nd input argument). This is later reset to the initial
	atmlab('VERBOSITY') value when the function is exited

2013-03-21  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-312

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Adopted to new abs_speciesSet.
	abs_xsec_agenda_checkedCalc and
	propmat_clearsky_agenda_checkedCalc included automatically for
	standard usage.

	* demos/qarts_demo.m:
	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (cfile_AtmSrf):
	* arts/qarts.m (qarts): Removed EDENSITY_FIELD, as done in arts.

2013-03-20  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-311

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	(read_granule):

	- Bugfix, use datahash for correct generation of cache

	(find_granule_first_line): nano-change

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m(process_delayed):

	- Improve error message when data are not properly sorted.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(collocate_and_store_date), (collocate_date):

	- Added flag 'autofix', if data are b0rked it will try to fix it by
	recollocating immediately.

	* datasets/define_c2dp.m, datasets/define_datasets.m,
	site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Split c2dp into mhs/amsub

	* datasets/define_datasets.m: Bugfix for amsub

2013-03-19  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-310

	* retrieval/mci.m: Mofified header to make clear the p is optional
	input argument. Introduced M.norm_w (default keeps old behaviour).

	Changed the normalisation to use the median of the PDF (instead of
	mean), small impact but keep the mean of w a bit closer to
	1. Note that the mean of w tend to be above 1, from 1.2 for m=3 to
	3.3 for m=10 (assuming perfect knowledge of S).

2013-03-18  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-309

	* collocations/Collapser.m, collocations/FieldCopier.m,
	collocations/AssociatedDataset.m,
	collocations/FieldMultiInstrumentCopier.m,
	collocations/AssociatedPOESPlusCPR.m,
	collocations/CollocatedDataset.m, datasets/HomemadeDataset.m,
	datasets/SatDataset.m, datasets/CollocatedMicrowaveOnlyIWP.m:

	- Make all properties transient, effectively prohibiting
	serialisation.

	* collocations/SatDataset(saveobj):

	- Issue a warning (errors don't work) when trying to serialise data,
	pointing out that it's not going to work.

2013-03-14  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-308

	* graphs/save_figure_multi.m: Added

	- Helper function to store a figure in multiple formats, e.g.
	eps/png/fig

	* datasets/SatDataset.m(find_granule_first_line):

	- If no granules found, simply return after reporting so, don't
	subsequently crash.

2013-03-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-307

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (cfile_Absrpt): Initialize abs_xsec_agenda.

2013-03-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-306

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m:

	Adapt for change in arts-2-1-549 abs_mat_per_species renamed to
	propmat_clearsky.

2013-03-12  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-305

	* handy/freeRAM.m: Output on Mac was GB instead of MB.

2013-03-11  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-304

	* handy/freeRAM.m: Slight update in header and error message

	* datasets/modis_postprocessor.m: Added more pseudo_fields

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Updated some paths

2013-03-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-303

	* Note compatibility braking change in atmlab and prstnt_struct !!!

	* arts/qarts_atm_field.m:
	* arts/qarts_vmr_field.m: Header was vague regarding  input time
	arguments. Variables also renamed for clarity.

	* gformat/isatmdata.m: Description of hour-dimension slightly
	extended.

	* gformat/atmdata_regrid.m: Minimal change of header.

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: No active change, but note that the change
	below affects this function. Now this
	  v = atmlab( 'VERBOSITY', 2 );
	      atmlab( 'VERBOSITY', v );
	gives no change. The VERBOSITY at end the original value, while
	before this would set VERBOSITY to 2.

	* handy/prstnt_struct.m: Changed behaviour when setting a field.
	The returned value is now the old value. Before it was the new.
	This is more consistent with similar matlab functions, as pointed
	out by Gerrit.

2013-03-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-302

	* demos/qarts_mcdoit_demo.m:

	Need to pass rtp_pos instead of rte_pos to InterpAtmFieldToRtePos now.

2013-03-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-301

	* pyarts/tmatrix.py.tmplt: Fix template to work with latest PyARTS.

2013-03-07  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-300

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m(collocate):

	- Bugfix: if grids extend to the poles, no. of lon-cells to check for
	particular lat becomes infinite. Explicitly maximize to total no. of
	lons.

2013-03-07  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-299

	* math/column_integrate.m: Made a message clearer

	* geographical/resample_geodata.m: Esthetics

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:
	- Fixed bug in a pseudo field (atts wrong level)
	- Fixed unlikely bug in one of my collapsers
	- Update valid ranges for the new cloud_cci data

	* datasets/dardarsub_postprocessor.m: Assigning missing_value
	instead of allowing the data to be NaN;

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: updated paths

2013-03-06  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-298

	* math/DataHash.m: Added

	- Actually been using this one for months, but never added, oops.

2013-03-04  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-297

	* collocations/Collapser.m(process_granule):

	- Give an understandable error message if the processor does not
	return a correctly sized bit of data to fit into the collapsed
	dataset (basically [1 ncol]).

2013-03-04  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-296

	* math/bin.m:

	- Reïmplemented. Sorting the data first yields a much faster
	algorithm.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m(collocate):

	- Use self.cache for the gridding, because subsequent pairs often
	share at least one granule.

	* handy/CachedData.m(evaluate):

	- Improve documentation
	- Improve verbosity

2013-03-04  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-295

	* math/bin.m:

	- Oops, don't do the same work twice.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m(collocate):

	- Be more verbose in informing user what I'm gridding and how

2013-03-04  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-294

	* math/vec2col.m:

	- Define wid before use

2013-03-04  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-293

	* math/bin_nd.m:

	- Bugfix. Now it works correctly and fast! However, remains in β.

	* math/vec2col.m, math/vec2row.m:

	- Make sure return value is always a column/row vector, even if one
	dimension is 0

	- Issue a warning if all dimensions are 0, because then making it a
	column/row vector is impossible.

	* math/binned_statistics.m, math/binning.m:

	- Link to related functions

	* math/bin.m:

	- Make sure one always returns a column vector, even in corner cases.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	- Added property 'binning', set by default to 'experimental' which
	means 'collocate' uses bin_nd as opposed to binning_fast.
	Alternatively set to 'classical' to use binning_fast.

	- Set default gridsize to 1 to account for the faster binning.

	(collocate):

	- Optionally use bin_nd, much faster and same results as binning_fast.
	Still experimental. If you run into trouble, set property 'binning'
	back to 'classical'.

2013-03-04  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-292

	* math/bin_nd.m: Much faster binning function. For 200k elements, 20x
	faster than binning_fast. Not ready for production-use yet, still
	being tested, but promising results.

	* math/binning_fast.m: Use uint32 not class(indata) for counts.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m(find_granules_by_datetime): Bugfix

	Added postprocessor to make pseudo fields for dardar

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:
	- Fixed some issues with the pseudo_fields.
	- Decided to restructure the funtion.
	- getSelection is its own subfunction
	- all the dataset fields are now gathered and listed in a
	subfunction at the end of the file.

2013-02-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-285

	* h2o/thermodynamics/spechum2e.m (spechum2e): New.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m: Fixed bug in determining the names of the
	dependent fields belonging to pseudo_fields

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:
	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:
	Added quite a few new datasets, added pseudo_fields

	* datasets/common_read_cpr.m:
	Removed subfunction dealing with pseudo_fields. This is now taken
	care of by the function to be used by the new SatDataset method
	reader_processor. (e.g., self.reader_processor = @cpr_postprocessor)
	* datasets/cpr_postprocessor.m: Added

	* deprecated/common_read_cpr_2BCWCRO.m:
	Moved to depricated. Deprecated since it is not general and
	common_read_cpr.m  is a better suited to read all kinds of
	cloudsat data.

	* deprecated/cloudsat_read_zipped.m:
	Moved to depricated. Deprecated by the change to read_cloudsat_hdf.m

	* sensors/read_cloudsat_hdf.m: Added code to automatically
	uncompress (and later delete the uncompressed) input file if it
	ends in .gz,.zip, or .bz2

2013-02-27  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-282

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(verify_addis):

	- Use self.verify_addis(...)

2013-02-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-281

	* geodetic/r_crossing.m:Added two missing ;

2013-02-25  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-280

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	- Added two new members: 'reader_processor' and 'pseudo_fields'.
	  See documentation for details.

	(read_granule):

	- Allow for pseudo fields. For pseudo fields, the fields listed in the
	dependencies are passed on to 'reader' whereas the pseudo fields are
	passed on to 'reader_processor'. See documentation for the new members
	for details.

	- Verify that all expected fields are actually there.

2013-02-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-279

	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: Made P_GRID coarser. Retrieval grids are
	now set based on P_GRID, that is beneficial to keep representation
	errors low.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.m: Added oem's X as output, to make it
	possible to obtain e.g. Xiter.

2013-02-22  Ole Martin Christensen  <olem@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-278

	* demos/qarts_demo2.m: Added ANTENNA_DO = true so that the antenna

2013-02-19  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-272

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m:

	- Added property 'mattype', defaults to 'double', can be set to
	'single' as for the type used internally for the collocations. Saves
	50% memory but may lead to loss of precision.

	* collocations/FieldCopier.m(process_granule):

	- Catch case when sibling was found, but cannot be read.

	- Use self.mattype

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m: Use self.mattype

	* datasets/common_read_cpr.m: Don't overcatch

	meta-data of the defined dataset.

	* datasets/common_read_cloud_cci.m: Adapted to new loadncvar conventions

	* datasets/define_datasets.m: Added missing attributes for all
	considered variables.

	- Added height as metadata to dardar_subsel since this is the same
	in all granules that I tested and therefore does not need to be
	repeated.
	- Added some missing_values

2013-02-13  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-264

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	- Add property `metadata`, that can be used for arbitrary information.
	It's not used by the toolkit.

	- Make clear that this is only for reading *homegrown* netcdf
	datasets.

2013-02-13  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-263

	* collocations/FieldCopier.m(process_granule):

	- Fixed bug related to reflat. Coincidentally, the code is simplified

2013-02-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-260

	* files/loadncattr.m: Don't break if variable has no attributes.

	* files/loadncglobalattr.m:

	Don't break if there are no global attributes in the file.

	* files/getncattributes.m: Removed.

2013-02-09  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-259

	* files/loadncattr.m: Added function dedicated for extracting
	only the attributes for the variables you are interested in. if
	no variable names are given, the attributes of all the variables
	in the netcdf file are retrieved.

	* files/loadncglobalattr.m: Added function dedicated for extracting
	only the global attributes of a netcdf file. This is very similar to
       getncattributes.m that may or may not disappear as a consequence.

	* files/loadncfile.m: use the newly created loadncglobalattr.m to
	load the global attributes

	* files/loadncvar.m: Output the attributes for the read variables
	instead of the global attributes if nargout ==2

	* handy/sanitise.m: Added "&" to list of symbols to be sanitised

	* datasets/common_read_cloud_cci.m: Added reader for new dataset.

	* datasets/MaskInvalidGeoTimedataWithNaN.m: Only put the NaNs in
	the time, lat, lon data fields since the other fields may have data
       types might not support NaNs

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:
	Added cloud_cci, a fieldcopier and a collapser. Added attributes to the old modis collapser

	filler value defined, give a helpful error message.

	* collocations/AssociatedPOESPlusCPR.m:

	(AssociatedPoesPlusCPR):
	
	- Use self.setmems() to set members-field, because this needs to be
	recalculated when either of the sub-fieldcopier properties are
	updated, e.g. to set a missing_value attribute.

	(setmems):

	- Update the members-field from the sub-fieldcopier members fields.
	
	(translate): Cosmetic change

	* handy/exec_system_cmd.m:

	- Do not always write to stream 1, use atmlab('OUT') instead.

2013-02-07  Salomon Eliasson  <seliasson@ManUtd>

	* atmlab-2-1-256

	* geographical/ungridded2gridded.m:
	- Improved function by better defaults
	- Added more options
	-	like a user defined masking fhandle
	-       Possibility to just return a grid of cells containing all
	of the original measurements in vectors after allocating them to a
	grid box.
	- Better documentation

	* math/binned_statistics.m: Fixed bug if you want to replace empty cells with something (e.g., NaN)

	that has dodgy lat-lons before plotting

2013-02-07  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-2-1-255

	* arts/xml/xmlWriteCIARecord.m: Add writing routine for CIARecord.

	* atmlab-2-1-254

	* arts/xml/xmlReadCIARecord.m: Add reading routine for CIARecord.

2013-01-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-253

	* arts/arts.m: Added '-echo' to system call, in order to get the
	output displayed directly, instead of first when the arts run is
	completed.
	Is this backward compatible? Tell me if you get an error due to this.

2013-01-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-252

	* demos/qarts_demo2.m: Now using the new feature below.

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (add_agenda): Added a feature to more easily
	use pre-defined agendas. If the agenda definition straing array
	has length 1, and the string starts as name_of_agenda__, a call of
	Copy is added instead of a definition of the agenda. That is, this
	now works: Q.REFR_INDEX_AGENDA = { 'refr_index_agenda__GasThayer' };

2013-01-28  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-251

	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: Some spell fixes and some comments added.

	- Adapt to altered find_granule_by_datetime (see yesterdays commit).

	* collocations/FieldCopier.m:

	(process_granule):

	- Handle more nicely the case of a missing sibling-dataset. If set, a
	filler value in self.members.field.missing will be used instead. If
	this is not set, an error message will tell the user to set it. If the
	filler value is used, this shall be recognised by
	CollocatedDataset.read, and it will be replaced back by nans upon
	reading, with an appropriate message. The second part is not yet
	implemented. WORK IN PROGRESS.

	* handy/none.m: Added

	- Smill utility in analogy to `all` and `any`.

2013-01-24  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-249

	* graphs/scatter_density_plot.m:

	- Bugfix related no option 'normalise'

	* sensors/ssmt2_reader_netcdf.py:

	- When error, use exit code 1, not 0

	- Catch situation when there is no "number of data records". Instead,
	use "number of records" minus "number of header records".

	* time/unixsecs2date.m:

	- Re-implemented. No more rounding issues. Also no more fractional
	seconds.

	* time/iso_timestamp.m:

	- Adapt for lack of fractional seconds in unixsecs2date

	* geographical/shift_longitudes.m:

	- Bugfix. Was getting endless loop if input invalid, e.g. range larger
	than 360. Will now throw an error if this is the case.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	(reader): Document what error shall be thrown.

	(overlap_granule):

	- Get rid of "tolerance" option, redundant with
	bugfix in unixsecs2date.

	* handy/CachedData.m (evaluate):

	- Added method to evalute arbitrary expression and cache the result.
	  If the same expression is asked to be evaluated again, the result is
	  rather read from cache, saving considerable time. Can of course also
	  be used with PersistentCachedData, because this is a child-class.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m, datasets/HomemadeDataset.m:

	- Moved `pcd` property from CollocatedDataset to HomemadeDataset

	* sensors/ssmt2_read_ngdc.m: Added.

	- Reader for SSM-T/2 from NGDC data

	* sensors/ssmt2_reader_netcdf.py: Added

	- Used by reader. Needs Python + NetCDF-library. Permission pending.

	* sensors/ssmt2_read.m: Added deprecation warning to docs.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Added smmt2. Work in progress.

2013-01-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-247

2012-12-18  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-243

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m(process_delayed):

	- If primary is from timefile AND two granules start at the same time,
	but DO NOT have the same orbitid, the core is found but the associated
	not, so it fails here. Haven't found a satisfactory fix yet, commented
	out non-working solution for now.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:
	
	(find_granule_by_datetime):

	- Use self.get_starttime to prevent missing granules

	- Convert longitudes in range [0, 360] to longitudes in range [-180,
	180].

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(overlap_granule): Use get_starttime() method to get start time

	(find_granule_by_datetime):

	- Fixed bug where id was interpreted as seconds

	(read_granule):

	- Add version if available in filename but not in data

	- Fixed bug in interpreting firstline

	(get_starttime):

	- Adapt so it can be used for any granule, not only the ones that
	don't have info in the filename

	* datasets/common_read_saphir:

	- Transpose lat/lon

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: Improved finding the right
	resolution to internally grid (using nearneighbor) ungridded data.

2012-12-06  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-326

	* sensors/read_saphir_l1.m: Added

	- Reading routine for saphir l1 data. Mostly written by Mathias
	with small adaptations by me.

	* datasets/common_read_saphir.m: Added

	- Higher leven function to plug into collocation system. Possibly
	unfinished.

	* files/uncompress.m: Expanded

	- Don't stubbornly continue when uncompression fails, instead
	provide an option what to do: ignore, warn, or quit with error
	message. Also, use atmlab('WORK_AREA') as tmpdir by default.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Improved saphir, added three necessary props.

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Improved saphir regexp

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	(re): Expanded documentation for this property, reflecting that also
	orbitno and orbitno2 may be needed.

	(needs_starttimesfile): Added property for those needing
	starttimesfile

	(starttimes): Added property. Database of starting times. Has
	getter/setter.

	(starttime_fullpath): Added read-only property to get the fullpath of
	the starting time. Uses a getter.

	(cachedstarttimes): Added read-only property to cache starting times
	for granules.

	(SatDataset): Use default value for starttimesfile

	(get_starttime): Implemented. Retrieve starting time based on
	granule-id.

	(set_starttime): Implemented. Read starting-time from granule and
	store this in mapping table.

	(find_granules_by_date): Expanded

	- The granule-matrix now has a 6th column that is used for instruments
	where the filename does not unique determine the starting time. The
	6th column is used for a identifier that can be uniquely calculated
	from information obtained from the filename, e.g. one or more numbers
	representing the orbit(s).

	(find_granule_by_datetime): Expanded

	- Adapt for new style of granule-matrix. If self.needs_starttimesfile
	is true, the sixth column (orbit-id or so) must also be equal to the
	rest. Note that this is incompatible with the use of a tolerance —
	there must be an exact match.

	(find_granules_for_period): Expanded

	- Make the 'spec' argument optional

	- Adapt for new granule-matrix style (more preallocation).

	(find_granule_first_line): Expanded

	- Adapt for new style of granule-matrix. Now considers the option that
	the starting time needs to be obtained from the file (using
	self.get_starttime).

	(get.starttimes): Added. Getter for starttimes property.

	- Read from self.cachedstarttimes if possible, otherwise read from
	file.

	(set.starttimes): Added. Add particular starting time and store to
	file.
	
	* datasets/common_read_avhrr_cmsaf_gac.m: Minor change (added "see
	also")

	* atmlab-2-1-323

	* geographical/ungridded2gridded.m: Added function to easily grid,
	for example, ungridded "swath" satellite data to a regular
	grid. Is really a wrapper around binning_fast() and binned statistics().

	* geographical/resample_geodata.m: Made clear in docs that this
	function is only for gridded data

	* math/binning_fast.m: added assertion if in.region is not numeric

	* atmlab-2-1-317

	* files/loadvar.m: Expanded

	- By default, `load` tries to read any file whose name doesn't add in
	mat as ASCII. Now, loadvar will try to read it as MAT if loading it as
	ASCII fails due to a formatting error.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m: Expanded

	- In preparation for handling Saphir data, add properties and methods
	for getting the starting time from an external file. The methods are
	documented but not yet implemented.

2012-08-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-259

2012-07-16  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-254

	* collocations/Collapser.m:

	- Fieldstruct now also uses a member 'incore'; if this is set to a
	value evaluating to true, the processing will not be done upon the
	AssociatedDataset, but upon its parent (e.g. the CollocatedDataset).

	(Collapser):

	- When incore is set, self fieldstruct.field.origin to cd; otherwise
	to ad.

	* atmlab-2-1-248

	* handy/PersistentCachedData.m: Grew tired of info.mat crashing

2012-06-01  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* handy/PersistentCachedData.m(disk_free):

	- Use stat -f instead of df -k to get disk-free

	fields smaller).

2012-05-28  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

2012-05-25  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-219

	* handy/PersistentCachedData.m:
	- Added a default minimum free disk space to avoid filling your
	disk with cache data.

	- added method that calculates the amount of free space on your
	drive using the 'df -k <CACHEDIR>' command. output is converted
	to bytes.

	- Now also check that there is enough free space on the drive, not
	just enough compared to what you want to allocate for the cache

	* files/uncompress.m:
	- use -d instead of -p in unzip to avoid making empty files if
	there is a failure.
	- Removed unnecessary assertion and throw better errors

2012-05-24  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-218

	- If it fails, also pass the error message, and give a nice
	error-identifier

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	(find_granule_by_datetime):

	- If 'tol' is given explicitly, always use the regexp-way to find a
	file (tol makes no sense otherwise anyway).

	(read_granule):

	- Add some checks
	- Use a one-second tolerance

	* datasets/CollocatedMicrowaveOnlyIWP.m:

	- Added some TODO-items
	- Increased hardcoded number of elemnts in network
	- Add limits as properties to object and networks
	- Add stored-file as properties to object and networks

2012-05-22  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-126

	* files/uncompress.m:
	- Added function the uncompresses files based on their file
	endings. If it neither ends with .gz or .zip it does nothing. This
	calls a system call to gunzip or unzip instead of using MATLABS
	own slow version. (ca. factor 3 time faster for the typical file
	sizes we deal with)

	* datasets/common_read_mirs.m:
	* datasets/common_read_avhrr_cmsaf_gac.m:
	* datasets/common_read_hirscs.m:

	* datasets/common_read_calipso.m:
	* files/loadncvar.m:
	* files/loadncfile.m:
	* sensors/cloudsat_read_zipped.m:
	- Use the uncompress function instead of the slow matlab versions

	* datasets/common_read_mspps.m:
	- No longer output empty attributes structure


2012-05-22  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-125

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset(read_single_day):

	- Set cleanup-object before creating 'tmp', if 'gunzip -c' fails,
	'tmp' would not get removed. OTOH, removing an empty file is just a
	warning, so that's okay.

2012-05-22  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-124

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m(cleanup):

	- Delete file even if error is not caught, before rethrowing.
	  Maybe this will get rid of the empty NetCDF-files?

2012-05-21  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-123

	* files/loadncfile2.m:

	-deleted depricated file. Use loadncfile.m instead. (although this

	* atmlab-2-1-118

	* datasets/CollocatedMicrowaveOnlyIWP.m:

	- New dataset. This is version 0.0 of collocation-based MW-only IWP.
	To generate data, NN toolbox is needed, to read data, it is not.

	* datasets/common_read_netcdf_dataset.m:

	- Reader for my dataset

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	- Add property 'sats' for multi-sat datasets, can be set for

	- Use 'overwrite' as a property, e.g. allow overwrite on for
	individual datasets, off for others

	- Provide sat/sensor-pair in logfile

	- Implemented TODO-item: when multiple associated-datasets exist, and
	one or more (but not all) already exist, read those from files,
	regenerate the rest. Note: this won't regenerate datasets present but
	depending on regenerated datasets (e.g. if FieldCopier is regenerated,
	Collapser does not automatically follow)

	(read):

	- Report reading from cache
	- Store info along with cache (but no function-handles, because
	function-handles store along with them the entire workspace!)

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Bugfix, collapsed CPR-AMSU-etc. was not including $SAT

	* handy/PersistentCachedData.m:

	(set_entry): Allow to store metadata in info.mat

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m:

	- Added 'members' property (see above for use)

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	poles.

2012-05-14  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-114

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	* atmlab-2-1-102

	* datasets/SatDataset.m(find_granules_first_line):

2012-05-09  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-101

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m(process_delayed):

	- Bugfix, correct comparison is >=0, not >0!

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	- Reimplement granules_first_line and find_granules_first_line. Rerun
	your granules_first_line-databases! Now a native Matlab Map, not a
	Java.Util.Hashtable. Additionally fixed a bug, flags are now negative
	respetively positive according to what should be done with the data.

2012-05-08  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-100

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m(process_delayed):

	* atmlab-2-1-97

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_inputs.m:
	-Fixed bug in class check for in.coast, and cleaned up a tad

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:
	- Added COLOR_BACKGROUND and COLOR_FOREGROUND to psbasemap

	- small changes: fixed some mlint warnings

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:
	-Puny update

	* datasets/MaskInvalidGeoTimedataWithNaN.m:

	- Added function to mask invalid data from the
	common_read_<dataset> functions with NaNs

	* datasets/{common_read_calipso.m,common_read_mspps.m,
	common_read_dardar.m,common_read_patmosx.m,common_read_cpr.m,
	common_read_modis,common_read_avhrr_cmsaf_gac}:

	- Mask invalid data with NaNs instead of just removing them
	- Don't flatten the data unnecessarily
	- Update the header

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:
	* datasets/define_datasets.m:
	- Added MIRS to the list

	* time/daterange.m:
	- Expanded so that it also handles datevec with
	h,min,sec.

	* math/binned_statistics.m:

	- Patch so that if func2str gives an unusable string for the
	structure, call it statistic1 , etc instead.

	- Passing an empty limiter is now also possible.

	- No longer try to be smart and pick another "replace with" value
	for empty cells is the class of the array in the cell are
	different from the class of the "replace value". Instead pass a
	warning.

	* sensors/atovs/atovs_get_l1c.m: small edit

2012-05-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-96

	* atmlab-2-1-95

	* collocations/FieldMultiInstrumentCopier.m(process_granule):

	- When one of the other instruments cannot be read, calculate what
	size of matrix should have been returned and insert an equally-sized
	matrix with nans instead.

	* collocations/AssociatedPOESPlusCPR.m(translate):

	- When origline is empty, result should also be, with same dims.

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Fix basedir for amsub_mhs and mhs_amsub (was wrong)

2012-05-04  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-94

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m(collocate_and_store_date):

	- Verbosely write how many collocations I'm going to store

	* handy/CachedData.m(CachedData):

	- Bugfix, should create structure in constructor

	* datasets/SatDataset.m(SatDataset):

	- Bugfix, should create CachedData-object in constructer, otherwise
	all objects will share one single cache.

	* atmlab-2-1-93

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(collocate_and_store_date):

	- Don't process additionals if there are no collocations

	(collocate_and_store_date_range):

	- Add a little function for the logfile-cleanup to leave a message in
	the log if collocations finished prematurely.

	* handy/CachedData.m:

	(set_entry) (del_old_entry):

	- Don't only output the size in bytes, but also in no. entries

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m(store):

	- Bugfix: don't try to define dimension if there are no collocs,
	  NetCDF doesn't like [0 nonzero] dimension.

	- Wartfix: Write newline after all fields, not every field.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m(read_granule):

	- Bugfix: Satellite-name was not included with cache-name due to an
	erroneous tilde. This caused cache for different sats to be mixed,
	which goes wrong as soon as collocations are performed between two
	granules for two different sats but with the exact same starting time.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- For dardarsub, also add temperature

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	- Added 'visible' property that controls whether this dataset should
	be registered with 'datasets', with 'self.associated' (see below),
	etc.

	(read_granule):

	- New special case, 'scanline_number' and 'scanline_position' are
	always added, therefore not passed on to actual reader.

	* datasets/datasets.m:

	- Only "register" dataset if self.visible is true

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m(AssociatedDataset):

	- Only "register" dataset if self.visible is true

	* collocations/AssociatedPOESPlusCPR.m:

	- For internal 'sub'-datasets, set 'visible' to false in order not to
	confuse subsequent reading-routines.

	* datasets/define_datasets.m:

	- Bugfix when checking if dataset is defined
	- Do not add redundant fields (B_LAT, B_LONG, etc.)
	- Add some more non-redundant fields
	- Add Collapser belonging to Holl10-like-dataset. Now I have more or
	less all the Holl10-functionality in the new style.

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Added basedir, subdir for new associated-datasets

	* collocations/FieldMultiInstrumentCopier.m:

	- Bugfix: 'members'-structure needs to be present not only after
	processing, but only when reading from disk without doing any
	processing.

	* collocations/TODO: Added item.

2012-05-02  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* datasets/define_datasets.m: Added

	- Now this is where datasets are defined.

	* datasets/datasets_config.m:
	
	- Trimmed to a minimum, moved most to 'datasets'
	
	* collocations/FieldMultiInstrumentCopier.m(FieldMultiInstrumentCopier):

	- In constructor, set 'members' to empty structure if it is an empty
	array.

2012-05-02  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-86

	* handy/CachedData.m(clear):

	- Added method to clear the cache

2012-05-02  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-85

	* collocations/Collapser.m(process_granule):

	- Bugfix: when no limitators are applied at all, keep everything. Was
	throwing away everything because no limitators were true.

	same tests were before repated when restarting matlab. 

2012-05-01  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-82

	* datasets/removeInvalidGeoTimedata.m:

	- Fixed bug.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	-d changed datestr(datenum(X), 'yydddddmmmHHMM') to 
	dtstr = datestr(datenum(X), 'yydd_dddmmmHHMM');

	* datasets/datasets_config.m:

	- Changed the primary for avhrrCMSAF on CPR

2012-04-30  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-81

	* datasets/HomemadeDataset.m:

	- Add 'members' as a private property

	(HomemadeDataset):

		- Actually do something in the constructor, so that the user can
		create their own HomemadeDataset; 'darsub' is such a one.

	(getmembers):
		
		- Retrieve private property 'members'.

	* datasets/datasets_config.m:

	- Added 'darsub', a HomemadeDataset for our own DARDAR selection

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- dardar now at /storage2

2012-04-30  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-80

	* collocations/FieldMultiInstrumentCopier.m (process_granule):

	- Bugfix. Pass correct flag NOT to remove duplicates when reading
	additional instruments from the same satellite, so that
	scanline-numbers between the two are consistent and therefore correct.
	Removal of duplicates is taken care of elsewhere in the processing
	chain.

	
2012-04-27  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-79

	* Moved a large number of files to a new "deprecated/"-directory
	  that is NOT included in the path by default. To use the old-style
	  collocation functions from now on, add the directory "deprecated/"
	  by hand. Those functions will not be maintained any longer (all are
	  now methods or are superfluous):
 	  collocations/colloc_process_data_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m,
	  collocations/colloc_process_meandata_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m,
	  collocations/collocation_read.m, collocations/collocate_date.m,

	  datasets/find_info_from_granule.m, datasets/find_datadir_by_date.m,
	  datasets/find_datafile_by_date.m, datasets/number_sats_in_dataset.m.

	* collocations/FieldCopier.m:
	
	- Moved documentation from constructor to property
	
	(FieldCopier):

		- Suggest 'realname' attribute when duplicate fieldname error

	(primary_arguments) (secondary_arguments) (needs_primary_data)
	(needs_secondary_data):

		- Use new 'fieldargs' static private method for shared code

	(fieldargs):

		- New static private method to get arguments passed to reader
		  from a particular field-structure (not dataset, consider
		  realname, etc.)

	(process_granule):

		- Implement new 'realname' scheme. The 'realname' attribute allows
		  for a difference between the name under which a field is stored
		  in the original data and the name under which it will be stored
		  in the collocations.

	* collocations/FieldMultiInstrumentCopier.m: Added

	- Working on new class that allows to get instrument on the same
	satellite, roughly the same resolution (same no. of collocs), but a
	different footprint size; e.g. when collocating CPR with MHS, find the
	closest HIRS and AMSU-A as well. Current status: code generates no
	errors, but results are garbage. Work in progress.

	* collocations/AssociatedPOESPlusCPR.m: Added

	- First implementation of FieldMultiInstrumentCopier; not working
	properly yet (garbage results). Work in progress.

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m: tiny change in docs

	* collocations/README: Update URI

	* datasets/datasets_config, site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	- Added AMSU-A, HIRS, AMSU-B
	- Changed default collocation distance for mhs-cpr to be consistent
	with my earlier work

	* handy/CachedData.m:

	(set_entry): Also output new size in verbose output

	(del_old_entry): Output new size after removing

	(cachesize): Move functionality to new method

	(toolarge): Use new functionality from cachesize

	* datasets/common_read_cpr:
	
	- Bugfix. Ensure correct field-cell orientation.

	* datasets/common_read_poes_radiometer.m:

	- Don't use old, deprecated info-finder; use OO style

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	- Remove TODO related to caching, because it's now implemented.

2012-04-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-78

	* Consolidating with atmlab-2.0:

	* retrieval/qpack2/qp2_l2.m: Somewhat improved header text. 

	* retrieval/qpack2/qp2_rel2vmr.m (qp2_rel2vmr): Code for
	S-matrices removed (did not work). Header text improved, now
	stating clearly which fields that are converted.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.tex: Added a section treating units,
	particularly rel and logrel.

	* arts/arts_oem_init.m (arts_oem_init): Removed some obselete
	comments.

	* retrieval/oem.m: Some small improvements of help text. 

	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: Q.HSE.P now set to first element of
	pressure grid. Old setting of 1013 (Pa) strange, confusing and can
	cause that the surface slips outside the atmosphere after applying HSE.

	* h2o/thermodynamics/potential_temperature.m: corrected name of
	variables according to earlier commit in physics/constants.

2012-04-27  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-77

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m (gmt_plot): Fixed bug if longitudes are
	in the 0:360 regime, but are not continuous after changing to the
	-180:180 long regime, which is done by default. e.g. if lons go
	from 80:300

2012-04-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-2-1-76

	* tests/test_arts_ppath.m (test_arts_ppath): Somewhat more

	effectively column integrates column data. E.g. IWC -> IWP

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_get_nctype3.m (nc_type): added function taylor
	made for netcdf3, since this is the default netcdf. Was
	erroneously supporting the uint types in gmt_get_nctype.m

	* atmlab-2-1-73

	* collocations/Collapser.m(process_granule): remove FIXME

	(collocate_and_store_date):

		- Be more helpful in output text

	(collocate):

		- Use object-local gridsize

	- Class to cache data

	* datasets/datasets_config.m:

	- Give dardar a sat (atrain)
	- Give mhsmhs a name, distance, interval

	(collocate_date) (collocate_granule):

	- When concatenating different granules, for the additional datasets,

	solve it yet.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	- Fix error in type for DIST and INT (float, not single)

	(read):

		- Fix bug in applying limitations; interesting in limited data,

	collocations/collocate_granule.m:

	- Adapt for changed error-ids

2012-01-31  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-258

	* geoplots/gmt/getAnnotFormat.m: Fixed bug, so that it is more
	robust and can handle negative numbers

	* geoplots/gmt/append_tickannotations.m: Fixed bad regexp

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Commented out warning that was annoying me

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: slightly optimized

	* geoplots/gmt/psscale.m: Small edits

2012-01-30  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-257

	* collocations/FieldCopier.m:

	(process_granule): shut up m-lint

	(store): don't fail TOO early, be versatile with inputs for now

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m:

	(process_delayed): Bugfix

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(collocate_and_store_date): More verbose

	(cleanup): WAAAAA! YET ANOTHER CHANGED ERRID!!!!!

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	(find_datadir_by_date): Less crashy

	(find_granule_by_datetime): Bugfix

	(read_granule): More verbose

2012-01-30  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-256

	* handy/intersect_unsorted.m: Added
		- Like Matlab's intersect, but does not sort the result. Pretty
		much brute-force algorithm, slow, but okay for short cellstr.

	* datasets/common_read_cpr_2BCWCRO.m:
		- Convert all 1-D fields into column vectors. This is needed for
		later processing.

	* datasets/SatDataset.m:

	(find_granule_by_datetime):
		- make default tolerance 0.01 seconds, due to nasty rounding
		issues with unixsecs2datetime and datetime2unixsecs. Also pass
		seconds, for the same reason.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:

	(collocate_granule): tiny change
		- explicitly tell read_granule not to force it (e.g. should still
		throw an error if it fails)
	
	(collocate_and_store_date):
		- pass info on to process_delayed

	(process): bugfix
		- add correct granule starting times. Round this to prevent later
		rounding errors / precision-loss errors
	
	(read_date): added
		- read collocations for a day. Return those, possibly in exactly
		the same way as they would have been read in the first place.

	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m:

	(process_delayed):
		- renamed from process_day
		- Divide collocated data in segments, pass each segment in turn to
		  .process(), reading data1/data2 in where needed, as indicated by
		  new abstract methods .needs_primary_data() and
		  .needs_secondary_data()

	(needs_primary_data) (needs_secondary_data): Added two abstract
	methods

	* collocations/FieldCopier.m:

	(process_granule):
		- Only access data-structures if needed, so that the method can be
		called from delayed-processing routines where not all data is
		actually read in.

	(needs_primary_data) (needs_secondary_data): Implement these methods (short)

	(store):
		- Method not implemented yet; make one-liner generating error
		message because it's an abstract method in the parent-class, and I
		want this class to be instantiable
	
	* datasets/common_read_collocation_cpr_mhs.m: Fixed typo

2012-01-30  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-255

	* files/loadncvar.m: small improvement

	- Class to be used when interested in copying fields from source
	granules (primary and secondary) to result dataset (one dataset).
	Writing to disk (NetCDF) is not implemented yet in the new system, but
	matrices are output correctly in CollocatedDataset.collocate_granule.
	For an example usage, see the top help text in FieldCopier.
	
	* collocations/AssociatedDataset.m:

	- Added 'dependencies' member to later determine in what order
	additional datasets should be processed, and for what additional
	datasets the output should be passed on to the next processor.

	* collocations/CollocatedDataset.m: 

	(collocate_granule):
		- Call correctly the additional processing functions

	* datasets/datasets_config.m:

		- Bugfix, collect data from all granules
		- Started work on additional datasets for processing

	(collocate_date): Added, mostly from collocate_date.m

	* sensors/cloudsat_read_zipped.m:

	- Added cleanup object

	* sensors/read_cloudsat_hdf.m: make sure that the output fields
	are not a 1x1 cell array, strings values are now always row vectors.

2012-01-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-249

	* sensors/cloudsat_read.m (unitconv) Changed to correct name of

2012-01-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-248

	* sensors/cloudsat_read.m (unitconv): Added a fix that should
	make the function OK independently if HDF returns strings as
	columns or rows. Row strings now enforced locally in sub-function.

	No time for testing. Please, report if any problems.

2012-01-24  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-247

	* sensors/cloudsat_read.m: Added note to help section that this
	function doesn't work from matlab 2011b ->, and suggest to use
	read_cloudsat_hdf.m instead, although this function returns the
	desired fields and there attributes as is, i.e. without scaling,
	converting etc.

	* sensors/read_cloudsat_hdf.m: Added alternative cloudsat reading
	routine.

2012-01-18  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-242

	* Started refactorisation of collocation codes.

		Aims:
		- More easily add collocation pairs
		- More easily specify fields of interest when collocating
		- Get/add additional data for existing collocations
		- Increase maintainability
		- Increase robustness w.r.t. duplicate scanlines

		Means (work in progress):
		- Redesign datasets configuration and implementation in an
		  object-oriented way
		- Split 'core' from additional data
		- More will follow

		So far, all is compatible, but for users of collocation or
		datasets codes, this will break some backward-compatibility!

	* datasets/SatDataset.m, collocations/AssociatedDataset.m,
	  collocations/CollocatedDataset.m:
		
		- Added, classes will replace datasets_* cruft and
		  find_granules_...  etc. functions, ultimately.

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m, datasets/datasets_config.m:

		- Started adaptation to new system

		
2012-01-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

2011-12-18  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-237

	* physics/constants.m: Made some fundamental changes, but kept it
	'nearly' backwards compatible. 'nearly' since I changed the values
	of quite a few constants, as they were unreferenced and I found
	other values, changed the values in the function, and included my
	reference.

	One major difference is that if you can call the
	function without inputs and a structure with all the constants and
	their unit are returned. Now, if you have 2 output arguments, the
	value and its unit is returned.

2011-12-15  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	of the value in question

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: Fixed bug if your in.tickval
	values don't fit in %.3f. Now use getAnnotFormat to get the right format

	* geoplots/gmt/reference_maps: Deleted, since I reckon they're not
	needed.

	* geoplots/gmt/xtra_nan_legend.m: Stopped frivolously appending the
	temporary direct to the file paths

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Stopped frivolously appending the

	* (forgot version number)

2011-11-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* tests/make_check.m: Wrong name of function in error message for
	qarts_scatting_demo.
	Changed target values for test with MC. (Don't understand the old
	values. Too high deviation from DOIT. And far too high Q
	considering that spherical particles used. For safety, made a test
	also with arts-2.0.0.)

2011-11-07  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	Y.TNOISE, then set to a vector.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.m (qp2_y2Q): The code for non-scalar

	* /obspm/datasets_init.m: Adding a folder and corresponding file
	with our (LERMA, Paris Observatory) specific paths. So far
	configured only to start using the collocations mscripts. We take the
	opportunity here to congratulate developer Gerrit Holl for coding
	such a nice and usefull piece of work.

2011-09-30  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-204

	* handy/exec_system_cmd.m: Added an extra output variable the
	returns the return value from the system command, if you set a 3rd
	input argument to true
	(continueOnError). In essence it lets the function keep going even
	if the system command fails. This does not break backward
	compatibility.

	* geographical/standardize_geodata.m:
	Fixed hilariously bad assertion

2011-09-30  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-201

	* geographical/standardize_geodata.m: Replaced
	homogenize_datalatlon with this function. This function is more or
	less the same as the previous, but comments from the programming
	meeting were incorporated including a function name change. The
	functions listed below were only changed due to adapt to the new
	function name.

	* geographical/regionize.m:
	* geographical/resample_geodata.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m:

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: fprintf to display the
	resolution of the data (if verbose)

2011-09-26  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-200

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Even nicer still.

2011-09-25  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-199

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m:
	Nicer programming to generate strings for info cell.

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Fixed 2 erroneous entries

2011-09-21  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-198

	* geographical/homogenize_datalatlon.m (homogenize_datalatlon):
	Made a little nicer before programming meeting (without changing
	any behaviour)

	* geographical/geo_single_localtime.m: Puny edit

2011-09-21  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-197

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	1) Fixed lame test to see if the data is centered.
	2) Updated the help section to only say that the data
	should preferably be centered for speed (otherwise
	resample_geodata will be called upon)

2011-09-20  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-196

	* geographical/resample_geodata.m:
	1) reference out structure to in structure so also unused fields
	pass through the function.
	2) no longer use == to check if the resolution of the new and old
	grid id the same (use eps = 1e-5).

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m (gmt_plot):
	1) Decided to silently allow the input data to be on a grid
	defined by its edges. I now internally call resample_geodata to
	shift such a grid to a centered grid. This is OK since no data leaves
	gmt_plot anyway.
	2) Implemented a nicer way of automatically defining the region
	using suitable formatstrings.
	3) Made a subfunction for this, since it was already doing this
	when deciding how to annotate the legend (how many decimals etc.)

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: cosmetics

	1) Fixed so the user can input in.cols for the combine_pdfs call
	2) Added 2 more ungridded tests
	3) demonstrated in.legend.tick_spacing to test 3, and made the
	legend nicer

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	1) changed input name in.nearneighbor.increment to
	in.nearneighbor.resolution
	2) Use logtext instead of fprintf.

	* geoplots/gmt/makecpt.m:
	Adapted to new conditions

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:
	1) fixed nearneighbor bug
	2) smarter automatic resolutions. Max automatic global resolution is
	1 minute (1/60 deg).
	3) use logtext instead of fprintf

	* atmlab-1-0-193

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: More desirable behaviour.

2011-09-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-192

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:

	* atmlab-1-0-170

	* files/loadncfile2.m:

	matrix (2D), number of levels, and conversion coefficient vectors
	A & B used for creating the matrix P = A + B*surfacePressure

	* geoplots/modlev2presslev.m: Included Marston's function for
	converting model levels to some desired pressure levels. For this
	you have data on model levels and a pressure matrix of the same
	size. The pressure matrix can be made using full_pressure_levels.m

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Fixed bug in determined if
	the data is centered or not.

2011-07-19  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-167

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Added an assert if your data is gridded
	but not centered.

	* geoplots/resample_geodata.m: Added an assert if your input data
	is not centered AND you use a scalar value to set the
	newgrid. Note: You can still make un-centered data centered by
	setting the new grid to vectors. e.g. if in.lat = -90:90 and you
	want a 1deg centered grid, newgrid = {[-90+.5:90-.5],[lons]}

	* geoplots/getPredefinedRegions.m: Added extra regions for
	Marston's article.

2011-07-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-165

	* Two changes that can affect your files:

	1. interpd.m and regrid removed (as planned and warned). 

	2. The atmlab setting EXTRAP is removed. If set, you need to
	remove it from atmlab_conf. This setting was mainly implemented
	through pointinterp.m and gridinterp.m. These functions now has
	*extrap* as an optional argument. All interpolation inside qarts
	and gformat is made with extrap set to true. That is, if you are
	not using pointinterp or gridinterp directly, you don't need to
	set anything.
	
	* arts/qarts_vmr_field.m: Changes of different kind to match
	* covmat/covmat1d_from_cfun.m: the changes below regarding EXTRAP.

	* math/regrid.m: As above.

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: EXTRAP removed as setting.

	* arts/arts_oem_init.m: For consistency with other R-fields,
	changed R.SENSOR_RESPONSE to R.sensor_response.

	* arts/arts_x2QR.m: As above.
	
2011-07-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-160

	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: A priori uncertianty now defined for several
	units and assumptions. Can be tested by changing a switch
	statement, but, please, make this in a copy outside atmlab (to avoid
	commiting with the switch statement changed).

	* retrieval/qpack2/qp2_rel2vmr.m: Averaging kernels were not
	converted, for same reason as bug fixed in 1-0-154. Fixed.
	Thanks to Ole-Martin that reminded me about this function.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.tex: Description of Y.F corrected. 

	* retrieval/qpack2/qp2_l2.m: Setting of Y.F did not work in case

	  - CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR: Outputs only the command outputs. Previously,
	    had a second output that was always equal to 0.
	  - Improved documentation.

	* atmlab-1-0-157

2011-06-16  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-154

	* retrieval/oem.m: Averaging kernal matrix was incorrect if
	O.sxnorm == true. However, could be correct for some conditions
	(my old test falled into this category). Bug found after
	input from Ole-Martin. The proper scaling is now made. 

	* demos/arts_oem_demo.m: Added code for tests with varying a priori
	uncertainty. Activated by changing an if-statement.

2011-06-16  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>
	
	* atmlab-1-0-153

	  collocations/colloc_process_data_x_to_x.m: Added
	  - Moved common part for processing collocations between two
	    identical sensors.

	* collocations/colloc_process_poes_poes.m,
	  collocations/colloc_process_data_poes_poes.m: Deleted
	  - This is now done via fanciness in colloc_constants.
	
	* collocations/colloc_constants.m: Adapted
	  - Used a subfunction with a nested function to do partial function
	    application, so colloc_process_x_to_x and ..._data_x_to_x are used
		for all where sensor pairs are identical.
	  - Moved common stuff to "generic" definitions
	  - Changed the following field names (for consistency):
	  	CPR/AVHRR:
			SZA -> AVHRR_SZA
			H_I -> HCS_I
			H_ZEN -> H_SZA
			C_ROW -> C_I
		HIRSCS/MHS:

			SZA -> AVHRR_SZA

	* tests/verify_colloc_constants.m: Added
	  - Test whether colloc_constants is somewhat consistent.
	
	* collocations/collocate.m: Adapted
	  - lat and lon are no longer automatically flattened by binning_fast,
	  so I need to do this explicitly.
	
	* sensors/find_scanline_overlaps.m: Added
	  - Finds first line in granule N not occuring in granule N-1.
	
	* datasets/datasets_config.m: Expanded
	  - Added collocations amsu/amsu and hirs/hirs
	
	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Expanded
	  - Added default Kiruna locations for collocations amsu/amsu and
	  hirs/hirs.
	
	* datasets/find_datadir_by_date.m: Minor change
	  - Corrected error message; basedir may be correctly defined, but the
	  directory not created.
	
	* collocations/collocate_and_store_date.m: Minor change
	  - Make error message more useful.

2011-06-09  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-143

	* geoplots/regionize.m:
	Fixed bug with edges and repmat of longitudes.

2011-06-09  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-142

	* geoplots/regionize.m:

	Added useful function that singles out user-defined lat/lon
	regions in data. The function will replace grid boxes that are
	outside the given region or regions with NaNs for easy statistical
	applications. A weighting matrix is output along with the output
	data so that grid boxes that are only partially in the specified
	region can be weighted accordingly. E.g. for a grid box(i,j) that
	is completely in the specified region, weights(i,j) = 1, and a
	grid box(i,j) that is partially in, 0 < weights(i,j) < 1

	* geoplots/getPredefinedRegions.m:

	This function is more or less a list of predefined
	regions. Expected Input is a cell of strings or a string. Each
	string is either the 'short name' of one of the predefined
	regions, or is a user defined region ('lon1/lon2/lat1/lat2'). The
	output is a matrix of [bottom left corner, top right corner]
	(e.g. [lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2;...] ).

	The list of shortnames of the regions will be listed if you call:
	list = fieldnames(getPredefinedRegions)';

	The attributes of all the predefined regions is:
	attr = getPredefinedRegions;


2011-06-09  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-141

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:

	Change rules a bit. If no second argument 'field' is given, and
	the in their is no data field called 'data' in the structure,
	continue the function with in.nodata = true (i.e. can still
	draw coastlines, etc)

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:

	A better way of determining the search radius if nearneighbor is
	used.

	* geoplots/resample_geodata.m:

	Fixed output variable name that got screwed in the last commit of
	the function.

2011-06-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-140

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m (getdatarange):

	Convert min/max to double otherwise log10 will fail if data is int.

2011-06-07  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-139

	* geoplots/resample_geodata.m:

	Complete overhaul after improvement suggestions from the programming meeting.
	- Now handles data sets with unlimited dimensions.
	- newgrid can either be a scalar, vector of 2 values for lat or
	lon, or they can be latitude and longitude vectors to map to.
	- Function determines from the resolutions of the input grid and
	the desired output grid which method to use.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: 

	Better error message

2011-05-31  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-138

	* geoplots/geo_single_localtime.m: Shortened at tad using modulo

2011-05-30  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-137

	* sensors/ssmt2_read.m:

	Check dsname in header to verify that the file is an SSM/T-2 file.

	Create cleanupObj2 only after verifying that fid is valid.

	Throw an error if the number of records read doesn't match the record
	number in the file header.

	Change apply_calibration to bool.

	Update docs.

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m:
	Fixed data so that lat/lons describe the center of a gridbox as
	gmt_plot requires.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	Better description of in.ticks.
	Fixed bug in determining automatic region.

	* geoplots/geo_single_localtime.m:
	Fixed bug permuting the final output

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/grdimage.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:
 	Make sure all tmp files end up in the tmp directory.

2011-05-26  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-134

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Fixed newly introduced bug

2011-05-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-133
	
	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: Add -f option to mv.

2011-05-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-132
	
	* retrieval/qpack2/qp2_l2.m: Added handling of 'ex', that now can
	be obtained through L2_EXTRA.

	* retrieval/oem.m (oem): Added 'ex' as possible output. This is
	the standard deviation of the a priori uncertainty.

2011-05-23  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-131

	* math/binning_fast.m: Substantial update of binning_fast.

	- It now handles multi dim data, but size(data,1) = length(lat) and
	length(data).

	- input in.gridsize may now be a scalar (as before), a 2 element
	vector(Latgridsize,Longridsize), or full lat lon vectors {[lat],[lon]}.

	* math/binned_statistics.m: Added 'UniformOutput', false so that
	it also works for matrixes in cells.

	* math/taylor_diagram.m: Cleaned up a bit

2011-05-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-130

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.tex: Fixed several spelling mistakes.

2011-05-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-129

	* Important for Qpack users. L2 output for ABS_SPECIES now follows
	the selected unit strictly. More information in qpack2.pdf and
	email to qpack mailing list.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qpack2.tex: Modified to reflect changes below.
	The information for L2 'ptz' was old.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qp2_rel2vmr.m: Created.

	* arts/arts_regrid.m (extract_grids): Introduced qname, to improve
	error message.

	* arts/qarts.m (qarts): Added L2_RANGE as sub-field to ABS_SPECIES
	and T.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qp2_l2.m (qp2_l2): For absorption species, the
	conversion to VMR for 'rel' and 'logrel' is removed. That is, the
	output follwos now throughout the retrieval unit. This is also the
	case for errors estimates. 
	Added handling of L2_RANGE (and this part of the function revised).

	* arts/arts_x2QR.m (arts_x2QR): "Extrapolation" was done for VMR
	independently of retrieval unit selected. This follows now the
	retrieval unit. For example, if "rel" is selected and the end
	value is 1.1, the VMRs on this side of the grid are scaled with
	1.1. Before the end VMR value was used out to the atmospheric limit.

	* arts/arts_oem_init.m (arts_oem_init): Improved header. Revised
	the set of variables that are stored as part of R.

	* geophysics/nd2vmr.m: Spelling mistake in header.

	* geoplots/gmt/makecpt.m: Fixed bug rounding values smaller than
	1e-6 to 0

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Tested 2 more projections and removed
	the high resolution test.

2011-05-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-126

	* sensors/ssmt2_read.m:

	Use onCleanup.

2011-05-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-125

	* sensors/ssmt2_read.m:

	Separate year and day of year into two structure elements.

	Add 86400 to ols if midnight is passed.

	Add documentation on how to get the exact timestamps.

2011-05-18  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-124

	* geoplots/geo_single_localtime.m: Added function that returns a
	global map of data with the same local time.

2011-05-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

2011-05-13  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-121

	* demos/qarts_demo2.m: Now works even if user not has set EXTRAP
	to true (as suggested by Oliver).

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Added Ignore(rte_doppler) when setting up
	abs_scalar_gas_agenda.

	* tests/make_check.m: Some error messages gave wrong name on
	tested script. 

2011-05-12  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-120

	* handy/exec_system_cmd.m: bug in my if-statement

2011-05-12  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-119

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: No longer check if outdir is defined
	properly or not. Fixed buggy implementation of onCleanup

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Added (?<end>) in some
	places.

	* time/dayofyear_inverse.m: Added some asserts and updated header.

2011-05-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-115

	* tests/make_check.m: Updated. 

	* tests/test_arts_qpack2: 
	* tests/test_arts_jacobians.m: Removed both(code very old). 

	* demos/qarts_scattering_demo.m: Added some now needed Ignores for 
	MC in IY_CLEARSKY_AGENDA.

	* retrieval/qpack2/ChangeLog: Removed this file. Just confusing to
	have a second ChangeLog. This file will be used in the future.
        As a consequence there will be no special version number for qpack2.
	The changes done under 2011 (to keep the latest history): 
	* qpack2.tex (subsubsection{General features}): Was Q=qpack2 which
	is old stuff. Now Q = qarts. Error reported by Stefan.
	* qpack2.m: Now using onCleanup to remove work folder.
	* qpack2.m: The option CalcTable is now not allowed for
	ABSORPTION. Too difficult to handle safely in a general manner.
	This must be handled by the user (and then using LoadTable). Use
	set ABSORPTION to 'OnTheFly' (in fact, can be the quickest
	option).
	* qpack2.tex: Adopted to change above.
	* qpack2.m (qp2_y2Q): Setting of Z_FIELD through HSE requires now
	that Q.HSE.ON is true. Added handling of Q.HSE.
	* qpack2.tex: Added text explaining that t_field etc. are ignored.
	Added text explaining the HSE part (see 6.1.2).
	* qp2_l2.m: Added output info from temperature retrievals
	* qpack2.tex: Added comments about the units of the returned fields

2011-05-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-114

	* demos/qpack2_demo.m: The example was not updated with respect to
	HSE and CalcTable. (Reported by Stefan, thanks)

	by default.

2011-05-06  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-111

	* handy/exec_system_cmd.m: Added special error check if there is a
	problem with the libraries called. The error output gives
	mitigating instructions on how to fix this for linux and MAC.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	- Use which gmtset instead to test if it is installed, and then give
	the appropriate error message.
	- Fixed bug for legend when plotting subset regions
	- By default no longer allow more colors levels than unique data values.

2011-05-04  Ole Martin Christensen  <olem@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-110

	* geoplots/resample_geodata.m: updated error messages. A new
	version of this function based on feedback from programming
	meeting is in the pipeline (half finished)

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: try to open final merged.pdf even if
	'pdfviewer', or 'open_command' is not set in gmtlab. Uses system
	'which' to see if xpdf, or evince, or okular is installed and
	picks the first hit to view the pdf.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Removed workaround for 'work_area'. and
	make sure tmp files end up in tmpdir

2011-04-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>


	* atmlab-1-0-95

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Added functionality for taking direct action
	when setting fields. This is now done for RAND_STATE and SITE.

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Default now is that a second call will
	result in an error. Can be overridden. Handling of RAND_STATE
	moved to atmlab. Header improved.

	* atmlab/addsite.m: Now using atmlab_path. SITE re-set to NaN in
	case of "unknownsite".

	* atmlab/atmlab_example_data.m: Now using atmlab_path.

	* atmlab/atmlab_path.m: Created.

2011-04-28  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-92

	* math/gridinterp.m: Missed to make add for the new functions!
	* math/pointinterp.m: Sorry.

2011-04-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-91

	* PLEASE NOTE: The name of the functions REGRID and INTERPD will
	be changed (to avoid the confusion around "regrid"). The new names
	are *gridinterp* and *pointinterp*. Both versions will exist for
	some time. So far you get a warning if you use the obselete version.

	* gformat/gf_regrid.m (gf_regrid): regrid -> gridinterp
	* arts/arts_regrid.m (arts_regrid):

	* math/gridinterp.m: Copy of regrid, with polished header. This
	is the version that will be kept.

	* math/pointinterp.m: Copy of interpd, with polished header. This
	is the version that will be kept.

	* arts/arts_oem.m: "Clean" option removed and try-catch in
	function removed. Both due to change below.

	* arts/arts_oem_init.m: Workfolder is now mandatory input. This
	function can not ensure that it is removed properly, and the task
	is moved to the calling function.

	* arts/arts_abcde.m:
	* arts/arts_abstable.m:
	* arts/arts_atmfields.m:
	* arts/arts_batch.m:
	* arts/arts_sensor.m:
	* arts/arts_y.m: All now using onCleanup to remove work folder.
	This made it possible to remove catch/try.

	function is now as it was before my meddling.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Temporarily set atmlab('work_area') to
	/tmp if it is not initialized. I uninitialize it again in the
	onCleanup call.

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Use the backup viewer option
	gmtlab('open_command') if gmtlab('pdfviewer') is not defined

2011-04-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-89

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m:

	'all_tests'->'all_tests.pdf', combine_pdfs requires the file suffix now.

2011-04-26  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-88

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	- fixed bug in in.region.

	- Fixed automatic legend. Better default behaviour if using
	in.projection = 'Q' (default projection).
	- fixed in.datarange to exclude inf when finding the maximum
	value.
	- change many: if bla, error('str'), end to assert(~bla, 'str')

	* geoplots/gmt/homogenize_datalatlon.m:
	Fixed bug where data was flipped if the input data is square
	(i.e. can't determine if it's (lat,lon) or (lon,lat))

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_nc_save_gridded.m: Make sure that z is single
	for netcdf.putVar

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m:
	- changed order of output
	- added more explanatory and up-to-date output describing figures.
	- testing some more gmtlab features

	* handy/catstruct.m: fixed bug by typo

	* geoplots/gmt/makepolar.m: Fixed bug for special case.

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: Puny update


2011-04-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-87

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m:

	As LaTeX is very picky about the filenames it allows in
	includegraphics (no spaces, no %, etc), the pdf files are now copied to
	the tmpfolder with sensible names to avoid problems.

	Use dir() instead of system call to ls to generate file list.

	Fix pdfinfo call.

2011-04-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-86

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m:

	Update docs. Include error indentifiers in asserts. Use fullfile.
	Make pdflatex behave well with dots in pdf filenames.

2011-04-21  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-85

	* datasets/datasets_config.m: 
	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m:

	Added more datasets with paths and regexps to the list

2011-04-19  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-84

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Use create_tmpfolder(tempdir) instead
	of create_tmpfolder in case atmlab('WORK_AREA') is uninitialized

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_catstruct.m: Deleted. adapted handy/catstruct.m
	instead.

	* handy/catstruct.m: Now also works recursively properly fields in
	a structure that are also structures.

	* geoplots/gmt/{ test_gmt.m, create_gmt_earth.m}:
	gmt_catstruct->catstruct

	* geoplots/gmt/psscale.m: changed error message

2011-04-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-83

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: Fix file ending.

2011-04-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-82

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m:

	Update docs.

	Use create_tmpfolder/delete_tmpfolder to make the LaTeX run safer.
	This way we don't have to call rm on unsanitized input.

	* ChangeLog: Add missing version number for previous commit.

2011-04-18	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-81

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m,
	  datasets/common_read_collocation_cpr_mhs.m,
	  datasets/common_read_avhrr.m,
	  datasets/common_read_hirscs.m: Changed implementation
	  - Reluctantly realised system('zcat foo>bar') is three times faster
	    than gunzip('foo') and changed the latter to the former

	* atmlab/addsite.m: Added
	  - Move this functionality to seperate function, as this too needs to
	  be called only when needed.

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Expanded
	  - Added ATMLAB_PATH. This can be used to override the path derived
	  from the location of atmlab_init, but is otherwise used to store the
	  ATMLAB_PATH by atmlab_init for usage in postponed initialisation
	  functions.

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Expanded
	  - Set ATMLAB_PATH for later postponed initialisation.

	* datasets/datasets_config.m: Expanded
	  - Do postponed initialisation, including calling addpath when
	  needed.

2011-04-18  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-80

	* files/create_tmpfolder.m: Allow user to bypass the need for
	atmlab('WORK_AREA'), by optionally providing an alternative

	left hanging in a temporary directory.
	4) Include a quickstart example at the end of the help section.

	* geoplots/gmt/
	{homogenize_datalatlon.m, list_colors.m, create_gmt_earth.m,

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: Fix bug in doc.

2011-04-15	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>
	
	* atmlab-1-0-72

	* handy/optargs_struct.m: Expanded
	  - Now handles structures recursively. If both the default and the
	    provided are a struct, they are both passed on to optargs_struct.

2011-04-15  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-71

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m: Code cleanup.

2011-04-12	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-70

	* graphs/satboxplot.m: Updated
	  - Also return plot handle
	  - Update documentation

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Changed behaviour
	  - Take away functionality for HDF5-reading. This is really not
	    working well yet.

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: Expanded
	  - Also add the date for which the collocations are to the NetCDF.

	* collocations/README: Updated

2011-04-11	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-69

	* collocations/collocate.m: Bugfix
	  - Also find collocations more than 2 longitude-cells away
	  - Made error messages understandable for people with limited
	    experience with civilised programming languages.
	  - Clarified documentation on longitude-ranges
	  - Rather than calling max(...) twice, call max and abs on flattened
	    copy of matrix.
	  - Adapt to Atmlab convention of having name.

2011-04-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-168

	* handy/combine_pdfs.m:

	Add function to combine several PDF files on one page.

2011-04-04  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-167

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	- Now cd into a tmpdir to let loose the temporary files there. This
	directory is deleted afterwards.
	- Fixed option to make a pdf out of only the legend.

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m:
	- Updated locations section to new input rules.
	- Dropping the idea of making gmtlab self sustained. i.e. don't
	test temporarily removing the atmlab paths.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmtlab.m:
	No longer case sensitive

	* geoplots/gmt/exec_gmt_cmd.m:
	Edited help section

2011-04-04  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-166

	* files/create_tmpfolder.m:

	Use matlab's tempname function to generate foldername. Append -atmlab
	to tmpfolder name. Add error identifiers. Avoid possible endless loop
	by bailing out after 100 failed attempts to create a unique folder.

2011-03-29  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-165

	* files/getfiles_matching_regexp.m:
	Added function that collects all files in a given directory (also
	checking its sub directories) that match a given regular
	expression.
	Usage files = getfiles_matching_regexp(dir,regularexp)

2011-03-17  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-164

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: 
	- Added input in.measure_unit to toggle the default unit all
	functions will use if the units are not explicitly given.
	- Changed in.legend.dimensions to in.legend.position for
	consistency with gmtdocs.
	- Added xpos, ypos, length, and width as arguments for legend.
	- Replaced ~ with getenv('HOME'), because some netcdf-functions
	don't like ~.
	- Now use the plot region dimensions rather than lat lons to
	decide if a legend should default to horisontal or vertical.
	- Removed frivolous mv command.

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: Adapted to changes explained
	for gmt_plot.m

	* geoplots/gmt/makepolar.m: Catch error if in.nwhite >	in.nlevels.

	* geoplots/gmt/psscale.m: Adapted to new legend options.

2011-03-16  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-163

	* geoplots/gmt/exec_gmt_cmd.m: Throw error for exit code ~= 0.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Fix mv command.

2011-03-10	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-162

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Bugfix

2011-03-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-161

	* files/loadncfile.m: First version to support reading groups.

2011-03-07  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-160

	* geoplots/gmt/{gmt_plot.m,pslocations}:
	Changed option in.locations.shape to only handle the shape of
	points on a map and not the size. Added option in.locations.size
	for the size of the point on the map.

	* geoplots/gmt/{create_gmt_earth.m,makecpt.m:}:
	Now supports giving a vector of tick values to use for manual data
	intervals. The tick values are saved temporarily in a txt-file,
	used in the -T option in makecpt and the file is later removed
	from outdir.

	* geoplots/gmt/cpt_from_colorrange.m: Clarified a bit better in
	the header.

2011-03-02  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-159

	* geoplots/gmt/makerainbow.m: removed unused function.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmtlab.m: replaced all depricated getfield and
	setfield using dynamic arguments.

	* geoplots/gmt/{save_nc_gmt_input.m, psscale.m, gmtlab.m,
	polygoninize_regions.m, exec_gmt_cmd.m, append_tickannotations.m}:
	changed error identifiers to gmtlab from atmlab

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: Puny change.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Changed the default outdir to tempdir
	(which looks for the system tmp dir). This for speed, permissions,
	etc. Now looks for if xpdf is installed is no viewer is set and
	the figure is pdf, but it still warns that you should define a
	viewer. Fixed bug so the in datarange rounding in the plot also
	work for unusual value ranges.

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Adapted to new outdir conventions

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_nc_save_ungridded.m: Changed function name from
	save_nc_gmt_input.

	* geoplots/gmt/makepolar.m: Fixed for special case if reference
	value is outside or on the edge of the datarange (caused crash).

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_nc_save_gridded.m: Changed function name from
	write_gmt.

	* geoplots/gmt/xtra_nan_legend.m: adapted to new outdir.

	* geoplots/gmt/makecpt.m: small bug

2011-02-28  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-158

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Fixed bug if in.outdir = NaN (default
	is gmtlab('OUTDIR') is not set), using isdir

2011-02-28  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-157

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	Added Oliver to created by, and my email for correspondence.
	Check if outdir exists.
	Get a default tick_annotation_format if none is given.
	Fixed bug where someone inputting in.legend=true stops the
	assignment of options to legend.

	* geoplots/gmt/makepolar.m: Fixed bug where RGB is sometimes
	negative (due to data precision)

2011-02-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-156

	* demos/qarts_scattering_demo.m: The emission WSM was used for
	IY_CLEARSKY_AGENDA even for the BL case. Works, but the dedicated
	BL WSM is better (of course) and is used now.

2011-02-24  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-155

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_optargs_struct.m: Changed header

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Fixed minor bugs

2011-02-24  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-154

	* math/get_ascend_decend_node.m: Changed header

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Futile change.

	* handy/splitstring.m: Added 'builtin' to exist for Octave.

2011-02-24  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-153

	* geoplots/gmt/{homogenize_datalatlon.m,create_gmt_earth.m,gmt_catstruct.m}:
	Changed header.

	* geoplots/gmt/save_ungridded4GMTplot.m: adapted to new
	default.outdir convention.

	* geoplots/gmt/{gmt_splitstring.m,write_gmtgrid.m,save_ungridded4GMTplot.m}:
	Added 'builtin' to exist for Octave.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Edited header, adapted to new
	default.outdir convention.

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Fixed bug where input was being ignored.

	* geoplots/gmt/cpt_from_colorrange.m: Better help text

	* geoplots/gmt/gmtlab.m: Changed default in.outdir to NaN instead of '.'

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_get_nctype.m: Added function that gets the
	correct netcdf type for the data variable. This enables the
	possibility of plotting logicals.

2011-02-22  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-152

	* geoplots/gmt/makecpt.m): Added verbosity to system command

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Edited help section, fixed
	some things for octave people

	* geoplots/gmt/gmtlab.m: Added psviewer to gmtlab (for eps and ps
	files)

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Had to add
	"'uniformoutput',false" to all cellfuns for octave users.

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: suppressed
	some output with verbosity

2011-02-21  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-151

	* geoplots/gmt/gmtlab.m: unbroke it
	
2011-02-21  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-150

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m (test_gmt): Added some info output about
	every test.

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m (create_gmt_earth): Changed
	splitstring/catstruct/optargs_struct to
	gmt_splitstring/gmt_catstruct/gmt_optargs_struct
	
	* geoplots/gmt/cpt_from_colorrange.m (cpt_from_colorrange): Changed splitstring to gmt_splitstring

	* geoplots/gmt/psscale.m: Fixed bad if-statement

	* geoplots/gmt/xtra_nan_legend.m: Changed splitstring to gmt_splitstring

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Call gmtlab defaults instead of atmlab
	defaults. Added verbosity as a default argument.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_splitstring.m: Cloned from atmlabs splitstring
	by Oliver Lemke. This is necessary for gmtlab to be standalone.
	
	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_optargs_struct.m: Cloned from optargs_struct.m
	by Gerrit Holl in atmlab. This is necessary for gmtlab to be standalone.

	* geoplots/gmt/reference_maps: Added directory with figures and
	README showing what the figures output from test_gmt should look like.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_catstruct.m: Added a more or less cloned
	version of catstruct. Important difference is that this version of
	catstruct also works recursively!

2011-02-18  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-149

	* geoplots/gmt/homogenize_datalatlon.m: Forgot this one.

2011-02-18  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-148

	* geoplots/homogenize_datalatlon.m: moved this file to the gmt
	directory instead

2011-02-18  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-147

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Decided to remove try catch. People using gmt
	will have to change atmlab('gmtoption','something') to
	gmtlab('gmtoption','something') in their startup file instead.

	* handy/prstnt_struct.m: Found another error without an
	identifier.

2011-02-18  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-146

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Removed options related to gmt from atmlab_defs
	and put them into gmtlab.m. Added a try catch around @atmlab_defs
	to instead call gmtlab if the desired option is missing. If option
	is also missing in gmtlab, throw the usual error. I've done this
	for backward compatibility, in case people have added gmt options
	via the old atmlab('gmtoption','something')

	* geoplots/gmt/gmtlab.m: Added function based on atmlab.m, but
	specifically for gmt options only. This is necessary if one only
	wants the gmtlab repository and not the atmlab repository. The
	gmtlab functions are now independent of atmlab (but still part of
	atmlab)

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Added check to see if gmt is not going
	to run, e.g. if gmt is not installed on the computer or if the
	gmt path is not set. Suggests how to set the environment in matlab.

	* geoplots/gmt/nearneighbor.m: Removed default -F option to be
	compatible with gridded data (assume gridbox centers)

	* geoplots/gmt/exec_gmt_cmd.m: Added identifier to error.

	* handy/prstnt_struct.m: Fixed the error messages so that they are
	usable (identifiers)

2011-02-14  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-145
	
	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (cfile_AtmSrf): HSE.P and HSE.ACCURACY saved,
	if set, even if HSE.ON false. This add jacobianCalcTemperature
	have these variables as input, even if not used. 
	Improved error message for ABSORPTION.

	* Qpack2: CalcTable is now not allowed for ABSORPTION! 

2011-02-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-144

	* This commit can brake some old q-files. But it should just be to
	remove USE_RAW_ATMOSPHERE. You should also remove calls of
	atm_checkedCalc.
	Note also changes qpack2.

	* demos/qarts_demo.m: Added demonstration on how to use HSE.

	* arts/qarts.m (qarts): Added field HSE.

	Modification of existing features:
	---
	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (cfile_AtmSrf): A call of atm_checkedCalc is
	now always included. No need anymore to include this by
	WSMS_BEFORE_RTE!

	* arts/arts_get_atmfields.m: Removed. The same function as
	arts_atmfields.m!

	* demos/qarts_demo.m: Adopted several demos to change below. And
	removed calls of atm_checkedCalc.

	* arts: Adopted several functions to change below.

	* arts/qarts.m (qarts): Removed USE_RAW_ATMOSPHERE. A "raw"
	atmosphere is now included if RAW_ATMOSPHERE is set. And in
	contrast to before, this does not override settings of T_FIELD
	etc. Any data in T_FIELD, Z_FIELD or VMR_FIELD are put in after a
	raw atmosphere has been read. Thus, more flexible now.

2011-02-08  Ole Martin Christensen  <olem@chalmers.se>

	(having D).

2011-02-03  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-139

	* arts/xml/xmlReadArray.m:

	Make sure the elements inside the array match the array's type
	attribute.

	* arts/xml/xmlReadTag.m: Add optional argument expected_tag.

	* arts/xml/xmlLoad.m:

	Use && instead of &, remove unnecessary sprintf from error calls.

2011-02-02  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-138

	* Some work to add temperature as retrieval quantity. HSE part is

	jacobian fields.

	* arts/arts_oem_init.m (arts_oem_init): 
	* arts/arts_x2QR.m (arts_x2QR): 
	* arts/arts_sx.m (arts_sx): Added handling of temperature as

2011-02-02  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-137

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Fixed bug where input
	in.legend.orientation was being ignored.

2011-02-01  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-136

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:

	Redirect output of viewer command to /dev/null to avoid blocking issue
	in Octave.

	* atmlab-1-0-133

	* gridcreation/grid_weightspaced.m: Created. (In Sep., missed to
	add it!)

2011-01-27  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-132

	* test_gmt now also works in Octave. Only one issue remaining where
	the font size of some titles is different in plots generated from
	Octave compared to the plots generated from Matlab.

	* handy/catstruct.m:

	Pass 1 (dim) as third argument to cell2struct to make Octave happy.

	* handy/splitstring.m:

	Added function to split a string into tokens at the given separator
	which works in Matlab and Octave. In Matlab the function uses
	regexp(...,...,'split'), in Octave it uses strsplit().

	This is necessary because Octave doesn't support the 'split' option in
	regexp, but Matlab doesn't have Octave's strsplit function.

	* geoplots/gmt/cpt_from_colorrange.m, geoplots/gmt/xtra_nan_legend.m,
	geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:

	Use splitstring instead of regexp directly.

	* geoplots/gmt/save_nc_gmt_input.m: Modified to also work in Octave.

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:

	Replace another textscan with sscanf.

	* geoplots/gmt/pscoast.m, geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m,
	geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:

	Replace %d with %f where applicable. Matlab outputs %d values as
	floats although the documentation says it should output them as
	integers which would also be consistent with the sprintf function in
	the C library.

	Matlab: sprintf('%d', 1.5') -> ans = 1.500000e+00
	Octave: sprintf('%d', 1.5') -> ans = 1;

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:

	Use sscanf to parse the region string instead of textscan or
	cellfunned regexps.

2011-01-26  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-129

	* geoplots/gmt/write_gmtgrid.m:

	Detect if we're called inside Octave and automatically
	switch to an Octave compatible implementation (requires octcdf to be
	installed).

2011-01-26  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-128

	section to make it easier to understand for new users. Also group
	some input arguments together for clarity. Removed the test_input
	section as it needed to be changed. The correct input is given in
	the help section.

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Added extra test, where I test drawing
	polygons on the map. Also  did some small adaptations

	* geoplots/gmt/psscale.m: Adapted to changed variable names

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: Cleaned up a bit and removed
	some frivolous sub functions.

	* geoplots/gmt/polygoninize_regions.m: Cleaned up a bit. updated help

	* geoplots/gmt/grdimage.m: Demands input cpt-file as second
	argument

	* geoplots/gmt/hardcoded_colors.m: This function and colortable is
	unnecessary as in.colorrange allows you make your own custom colortable

2011-01-19  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-120

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Cleaned up a bit, especially making
	each test a subfunction and included the option to run a subset of
	tests if you want. e.g. in.tests = [1 2 4]. Default is to run all
	tests. Also included some additional tests.

	* geoplots/homogenize_datalatlon.m: Catch error if the function is
	called with ungridded data as input.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: in.grid is now in.gridded and option
	in.varname is removed

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: Automatically pick a suitable
	map tick interval, if in.ticks is not given.

	* geoplots/gmt/nearneighbor.m: removed -O -K

2011-01-18  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-116

	* geoplots/gmt/append_tickannotations.m: Added function that makes
	it easy to change the legend annotations to whatever you want.

	* geoplots/gmt/cpt_from_colorrange.m: Added function to create
	your own color table (see help gmt_plot))

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:

	- in.colorrange.colors: Included shiny new option to easy create
	    your own color table. Basically, if you want a color table that
	    goes from e.g. blue-red-black, define where these colors should be
	    between 0-1, where 0 refers to min(datarange) and 1 to
	    max(datarange).
	    Usage: e.g. {{0,'0/0/255'}{.5,'255/0/0'}{1,'0/0/0'}}.
	    in.colorrange.color_model is used to specify '+HSV','-HSV',or
	    'RGB' (default='RGB')
	- in.ctable: Removed my own colortable except for mypolar, which
	             is a well suited color table for difference plots.
	- in.stepsize: Replaces in.ctable_cspaceing. in.stepsize is for
 	               the data-color levels.
	- in.sidebar: For triangles indicating data outside datarange in
	              legend. 0 (none), 1 (below), 2 (above), 3 (bellow and
	              above). This is determined automatically by default.
	-in.ctable:    default has changed to GMT's 'rainbow' palette.
	-in.nanlegend: default is true only if there are NaNs in the data.
	-in.datarange: For data range > 10, use floor and ceil for cleaner
	               data intervals.

	See help section for more details.

	* geoplots/gmt/makecpt.m: Added user options: COLOR_NAN (for NaN
	values), COLOR_FOREGROUND (for data > max(datarange)), and
	COLOR_BACKGROUND ((for data < max(datarange))).

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: Automatically scale the legend
	according to the map size.

	* geoplots/gmt/xtra_nan_legend.m: Always call this function,
	unless userspec in.nanlegend = 0 or there are no NaNs in the data

	* geoplots/gmt/psscale.m: Only display sidebars to legend if there
	is data outside the given data range.

	* geoplots/gmt/hardcoded_colors.m: rm frivolous stuff. Basically
	this whole function is frivolous now due to the introduction of
	geoplots/gmt/cpt_from_colorrange.m, and I'll probably remove it
	later on.

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: Added more test runs.

	* geoplots/gmt/*.m: svn:keywords "Date Author Id"

2011-01-06	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-112

	* sensors/atovs/unpack_bip.m: Added
	- Unpack Band-Interleaved-by-Pixel data (as used in AVHRR GAC)

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read_raw.m: Adapted
	- Don't be too smart trying to use Matlabs 10-bit reading-and-skipping
	functionality, it doesn't do what I want.
	- Fix bug, now once again possible to get only the header 
	- Preserve type (don't silently convert to double)

2011-01-04	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-111

	* geoplots/land_sea_mask.m -> math/land_sea_mask.m: Moved
	- I really don't think land_sea_mask belongs in geoplots. Math is not
	ideal either but already better, as it's quite generic (e.g. shouldn't
	be in 'sensors' or so either).

	* math/land_sea_mask: Adapted
	- Added functionality to read new land-water-masks from atmlab-data,
	as well as functionality to list all of those. Retains backward
	compatibility. I chose to add it here rather than to create a new
	function to prevent balkanisation.

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m: A bit more

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Fixed check input for scalars or logicals

	* geoplots/gmt/pspoly.m: Use -R and -J from psbasemap instead

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: fixed small bug related to
	plotting only coastlines.

2010-12-30  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-137

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:

	Cosmetic fix: Change the vertical offset of the NaN legend for vertical

2010-12-29  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-135

	* geoplots/gmt/test_gmt.m:
	Added function to test gmt_plot. To make sure it is still working
	if changes have been made to it. It is supposed to test
	everything, but I've only just started this one.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m (check_optional_input):
	Introduced input error checks to minimize weird behavior if the
	input type is incorrect.
	(hunt_down_errors): 
	Now keep track of errors and warnings invoked when calling GMT.

2010-12-25  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-134

	* geoplots/homogenize_datalatlon.m:

2010-12-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-133

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Changed threshold value for including V7-4
	folder, due to change below. 

	* handy/nversion.m: The function mixed up 7.10 and 8.0. To fix
	this, e.g. 7.5 and 7.10 are now returned as 7.05 and 7.10,
	respectively. That is, the function shoulds be OK for sub-version
	numbers up to 99.

2010-12-22  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-131

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m:
	Made some configure changes.

	* atmlab/atmlab.m:
	Added persistent variable: OPEN_COMMAND. As there are many file
	types available for the output figure it makes sense to open the
	figure using something like 'gnome-open'. e.g. set
	atmlab('OPEN_COMMAND','gnome-open') in startup.m

	* geoplots/gmt/exec_gmt_cmd.m:
	Updated in order to keep track of GMT output messages

	* geoplots/gmt/hardcoded_colors.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/makepolar.m:
	Smarter color tables. More desirable behaviour.

	* geoplots/gmt/grdimage.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/pscoast.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/nearneighbor.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/psscale.m:
	* geoplots/gmt/pscontour.m:
	Use psbasemap to open and close the ps-file and to define the
	region and projection. Commands that follow the psbasemap call
	now only need to specify -R -J

	* geoplots/gmt/pslocations.m:
	Enabled geo-located text without markers

	* geoplots/gmt/grdcontour.m:
	Fixed so that you can easily plot named contour levels.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m:
	1) Added short example in help section on how to create a figure
	2) Added more options to fine tune the appearance of the figure.
	3) More output figure types: in.figuretype supports pdf,ps,eps,tif, and png
	4) Catches errors in GMT script call

	additionally.
	e.g.
	in. gmtset={'gmtset HEADER_FONT_SIZE 15p','gmtset BASEMAP_AXES 	NsWE'}

	2) in.tick_annotation_format: Directly specify the format for
	legend annotations (e.g. in.tick_annotation_format='%3.1e')

	3) in.shift_tick_annotations: Move the tick annotations in
	reference to the legend in inches (e.g in.shift_tick_annotations=0.5)

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m (create_gmt_earth): 
	Updated legend section for tickspacing. Fixed NaN legend. If data
	can be determined to be global fix lon-region to -180/180.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m (gmt_plot): 
	
	Added option to manually decide how the ticks in the legend should
	be spread. in.tickspacing: x=> every xth data value, 1=>same
	number of ticks as datarange, []= one tick per contour level
	(default behaviour)

	Fixed option in.center, so that the user can define at which
	longitude to center the map (only for global data).

	Using homogenize_datalatlon, internally ensure that lat & lons are
	ascending, lons are in the -180:180 regime, and make sure that
	data has the dimensions data(lat,lon)

	Removed subfunctions unnecessary now that I use
	homogenize_datalatlon.

	Added more defaults to the setup section for better overview on
	gmt defaults.

        * geophysics/profile2column.m: changed bug and info

2010-11-23  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-116

	* handy/catstruct.m (catstruct):
	A very useful function for merging structures:
	
	X = CATSTRUCT(S1,S2,S3,...) concates the structures S1, S2,
	... into one structure X.

	CATSTRUCT(S1,S2,'sorted') will sort the fieldnames alphabetically.

	If a fieldname occurs more than once in the argument list, only
	the last occurence is used, and the fields are alphabetically
	sorted.

	To sort the fieldnames of a structure A use: A =
	CATSTRUCT(A,'sorted') ;

	* atmlab-1-0-115

	* gmt/gmt_plot.m: something small.

2010-11-22  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-114

	* files/loadncvar.m: Added note about loadncfile in help section,
	removed frivolous in argument and use v{1} instead of char(v)

2010-11-19  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-113

	* geoplots/gmt/save_nc_gmt_input.m (save_nc_gmt_input): As this
	requires ungridded data, immediately through an error if it is not.

	* geoplots/gmt/grdimage.m (grdimage), 
	geoplots/gmt/pscoast.m (pscoast), 
	geoplots/gmt/nearneighbor.m (nearneighbor), 
	geoplots/gmt/pslocations.m (pslocations), 
	geoplots/gmt/pscontour.m (pscontour), 
	geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m (create_gmt_earth), 
	geoplots/gmt/psscale.m (psscale), 
	geoplots/gmt/pspoly.m (pspoly): 

	Execute all gmt commands at the end of gmt_plot wrapper. No longer
	locally. All gmt commands have the -O and -K set as there is now
	dummy opening .ps and a closing .ps files in create_gmt_earth.m

	* geoplots/gmt/psbox.m (psbox): change from lat,lon to lon, lat
	to match x,y conventions.
	
	* geoplots/gmt/equidistant_contours.m (equidistant_contours):
	Adapted to new datarange

	* geoplots/gmt/makecpt.m (makecpt): Adapted to new datarange


	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m (gmt_plot): 
	- Now datarange in defined as a 2 element vector [dmin,dmax] (as
	xlim, etc.)  - Added subfunction to created a separate legend.pdf
	file if requested. - Disabled option in.center as it doesn't work
	with the way I define the plot region. I'll fix it at some later
	date.  - Now always quietly put data in -180:180 format to
	simplify things.
	

2010-11-15	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-112

	* graphs/satboxplot.m: Added (helptext repeated here)
	Alternative boxplot. Bins the data (in y) according to bins (in xbin).
	For each bin, plots the median (by default a horizontal red line),
	a box connecting to the 25th and 75th percentile, and whiskers extending
	to the 1st and 99th percentile. All other data are considered outliers
	and plotted individually. To change what the result looks like, add
	additional arguments that will be passed on to <a href="matlab:help boxplot">boxplot</a>

	FORMAT

	  satboxplot(x, y, xbin, outlierstyle, ...)

	IN

	  x               numeric array
					  Data according to which y is binned.
	  y               numeric array
					  Data for which statistics are carried out, binned
					  according to the values of x, etc.
	  bincentres      Bin centres for x 
	  outlierstyle    Style for outliers, e.g. 'kx'
	  ...     all additional arguments passed on to <a href="matlab:help boxplot">boxplot</a>

	* math/bin.m: Added (helptext repeated here)
	Bin the contents of y in the bins x according to the values in x.
	E.g. y(i) is binned according to the value of x(i). Binning rules
	as for <a href="matlab:help histc">histc</a>.

	FORMAT

	  values = bin(x, y, xbin)

	IN

	  x       numeric array
				  values determine how y is binned
	  y       numeric array
				  values to bin. Must be the same size as x.
	  xbin    numeric array, monotonously increasing
				  bin edges (as for histc)

	OUT

	  values  cell array
				  Binned values.

	* collocations/colloc_constants.m: Expanded
	- Add CLOUDFLAG to CPR/AVHRR, also when stored in NetCDF

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Bugfix
	- Wrong case when calling netcdf.getVar

	* collocations/colloc_process_cpr_mhs.m: Bug-introduction
	- Comment out annoying assertion...

	* collocations/colloc_process_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m: Bugfix

	* collocations/collocate_granule.m: Expanded, wartfix
	- Add some logtext if not all collocations are selected, due to date
	boundaries
	- Remove redundant (error-prone?) second dimension slicing for time
	variables.

	* circular/circ_mean.m: Bugfix
	- Fix bug (not in my code) when getting confidence intervals on
	non-standard dimension.

	* datasets/common_read_collocation_cpr_mhs.m: Bugfix
	- Use cloudsat time to determine if we're on one day. That doesn't have to
	be the case for amsub-time (that is output) but must be for cloudsat time.

	* atmlab-1-0-111

	* circular/*: Added
	- Added Circular statistics toolbox by Philipp Berens (BSD license).

	* circular/circ_meand.m, circular/circ_distd.m: Added
	- Those two written by me, counterparts to circ_mean and circ_dist that
	take angles in degrees, not radians.

	* AUTHORS: Adapted

	* collocations/colloc_process_data_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m: Adapted
	- Added cloud flag
	- Don't mix 3A and 3B, rather have it in 3rd and 4th column, as with
	CPR/AVHRR, and set the 'wrong ones' to nan.

	* collocations/colloc_process_meandata_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m: Adapted

2010-11-12	Gerrit Holl <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-110

	* math/angular2D.m: Removed
	- This really is too incorrect to be of any use.

2010-11-12	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-109

	* math/angular2D.m: Added
	- Calculate some angular/circular statistics. This is actually more tricky
	than I thought so this may be completely wrong, although it appears to be
	correct at least for mean and interpolation. Not sure if a generic
	approach to this (by converting to "linear space") is actually possible.

2010-11-11	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-108

	* sensors/atovs/avhrr_gac_read_data.m: Added
	- Read SOME data from AVHRR GAC. Actually no brightness temperatures as
	those are uncalibrated. So far reads just some pretty angles. In the
	future, it would be nice to calibrate this stuff natively.

2010-11-11	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-107

	* sensors/atovs/atovs_define_hirsl1c.m,
	sensors/atovs/atovs_define_amsual1c.m,
	sensors/atovs/atovs_define_amsubl1c.m: Adapted
	- Fix off-by-one error in angles.

2010-11-11	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-106
	
	* sensors/atovs/atovs_define_hirsl1c.m,
	sensors/atovs/atovs_define_amsual1c.m,
	sensors/atovs/atovs_define_amsubl1c.m,
	sensors/atovs/atovs_read_data.m: Adapted
	- Also return angles (lza, laa, sza, saa). This makes amsu_fov2za
	redundant for most purposes.

2010-11-10  Bengt Rydberg  <bengt.rydbergn@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-105

	* demos/asg_demo.m: updated, this demo generates atmospheric states

	* handy/fun2dwrapper.m: updated, removed an errorcheck 
	
2010-10-28  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-104

	* time/dayofyear_inverse.m: 
	Changed the output structure fields back to year,month instead of
	yr,mn. This is for consistency with the output name conventions of
	find_info_from_granule, which output year,month, etc of a file
		

2010-10-28	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-103

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Adapted

2010-10-27	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>
	* atmlab-1-0-101

	* handy/wait_for_existence.m: Added
		- Sleep until a file jumps into existance.

	* collocations/collocation_read_frompipe.m: Added
		- Read collocations from Pytables collocation server

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Adapted
		- Use Pytables collocation server when available
	
	* datasets/datasets_config.m,
	site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Adapted
		- Add paths for HDF5-collocations.

	        * atmlab-1-0-100 
	 
	        * gridcreation/p_merge.m: change 
	                 - Added some comments when using variable "debug" 

2010-10-22	Marston Johnston     <marston@chalmers.se>
	* atmlab-1-0-99

	* h2o/thermodynamics/e2spechum.m

2010-10-22	Marston Johnston    <marston@chalmers.se>
	* atmlab-1-0-98

	* gridcreation/p_merge.m: added
		 - function to merge two vertical profiles (eg., AIRS and MLS) using
		   the uncertainties of each profile to create a weighted mean.


2010-10-19	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-97

	* handy/homedir.m: Adapted
		- Smarter implementation (don't do a system call, just use getenv
		directly). Also add error identifier.

2010-10-15	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-96

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Adapted
		- @#$%$#@ Matlab changes error identifiers between versions!

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: Adapted
		- @#$%$#@ Matlab changes behaviour between versions; redefining
		dimension no longer permitted
		- use try/catch to close file no matter what

	* collocations/collocate_granule.m: Adapted
		- Make sure secondary version is defined even if no secondary file is
		read; set to '?' in that case.


2010-10-15  Claudia Emde  <claudia.emde@lmu.de>

	* atmlab-1-0-95

	* scattering/box_pnd_mono_size_1d.m: Corrected documentation.

2010-10-15	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-94

	* files/loadncvar.m: Adapted
		- Fix matlab2010b warning by replacing inqVarId with inqVarID.

	* datasets/common_read_avhrr.m: Adapted
		- Fix matlab2010b warning by requesting 3 rather than 4 output
		arguments from fileparts.

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: Adapted
		- Use random temporary filename
		- Check for existance of dimension before creating a new one; this
		caused an error in matlab2010b.

2010-10-15  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-93
	
	* math/isditto.m: Removed
	
2010-10-15  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-92
	
	* math/isditto.m: Make sure the arguments have the same size. This
	function may be pointless as there is an isequal built in
	function, but I don't know what that is doing do I'll keep this one

2010-10-15  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-91

	* math/isditto.m: Made a replacement function for obsolete
	"issame" function

2010-10-14	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-90

	* handy/struct2string_compact.m: Adapted.
		- Now also handles values that are not scalar numbers, but vectors or
		cells containing those.

	* collocations/limstruct2limmat.m: Adapted.
		- Now also handles cases where the limits only apply to a subset of
		channels.

2010-10-14	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-89

	* handy/optargs_struct.m: Added.
		This function provides a simply way to define default values for
		function inputs where this input consists of a structure. It takes two
		structures, one consisting of default values and one of user-provided
		values. It returns a structure containing the user values where
		provided and the default values otherwise.

2010-10-13	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-88

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m:
		- Fix bug occuring when requesting an aliased field for which channels could
		be, but weren't. Now correct for this by inserting the corresponding
		channels.

2010-10-13	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-87

	* collocations/collocation_read.m:
		- Return actual limmat and filters applied.
		- Add option to NOT apply those (but still return them).
		- Use new function cols_cell_to_cols_struct to get name_struct.

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m:
		- First write collocations to atmlab('WORK_SPACE'), only copy them to
		the final storage location when compressing (thus reducing the
		bandwidth used significantly).

	* collocations/cols_cell_to_cols_struct.m: ADDED
		- Mostly internal use, converts a cell array of column names (with
		possibly channel numbers in it as well) to a structure describing the
		same thing.

	* collocations/collocation_read_dual.m:
		- Adapt to modernity
		- Make sure at least one mean-field is requested
		- Correctly apply limits and filters
		- Improve documentation

2010-10-13  Ajil Kottayil  <ajil@ubuntu4>

	* atmlab-1-0-86

	* math/get_ascend_decend_node.m: 
	Fixed bug when ascend = NaN and clarified help section. 

2010-10-13  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-85
	
	* math/get_ascend_decend_node.m: Fixed help section. ascend=NaN if
	latitude is empty or has only one element.

2010-10-13  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-84
	
	* math/get_ascend_decend_node.m : Added function the outputs a
	logical if a pixel belongs to the ascend or descending node

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: in.rivers is flagged with a
	numeric and not a string from now on.

2010-10-12	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-83

	* collocations/colloc_constants.m: Define links differently.

	* datasets/common_read_collocation_cpr_mhs.m: Add comment about what is
	read.

	* datasets/common_read_avhrr.m: Don't cast epoch to uint32.

2010-10-12	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-82

	* collocations/colloc_process_*: Fix bug in time calculation. This bug
	affects the most recent collocation run.

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: Add global attribute
	'Conventions'.

	* collocations/collocate_granule.m: Determine version before giving up on
	collocations, making secondary version 'N/A' if primary is empty; thus
	guaranteeing a version is always indicated.

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Have one regexp for all POES,
	returning also the type.

	* datasets/common_read_collocation_cpr_mhs.m: Don't be silly, don't use
	uint32, that's asking for bugs.

	* datasets/common_read_poes_radiometer.m,
	datasets/common_read_cpr_2BCWCRO.m: Include the epoch. But not in uint32
	please.

2010-10-11	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-81

	* collocations/colloc_process_data_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m:
	Pre-allocate based on M_c rather than on collocs, as doubles were removed
	from the former. Replace unused input arguments by ~.

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: When a multi-channel field is requested
	without specifying the channels, return all channels rather than just one
	or crash.

	* collocations/colloc_constants.m: FIRST and LAST don't fit in short, make
	it int instead. Also add mandatory aliases field.

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Fix bug, flag for
	var-is-column is actually -1, not 0.

	* collocations/colloc_process_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m: Remove doubles
	after collocating.

	* collocations/collocate_granule.m: Check for emptiness /before/ rather
	than after fixing time.

	* datasets/common_read_collocation_cpr_mhs.m: Use C_TIME rather than
	B_TIME, as this has a better 'resolution' and as this one is used to sort
	per day.

	* ChangeLog: Document my changes.

2010-10-11	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-80

	* collocations/colloc_process_data_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_meandata_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m: Adapt
	to changed nomenclature in colloc_constants (still from the move from
	colloc_config).

	* collocations/collocate_date.m: If a granule takes exactly one day,
	assume it doesn't contain data for more than one day, and don't take the
	previous day in find_granules_by_date.

	* collocations/colloc_constants.m: Add HIRSCS/MHS and
	collocation_cpr_mhs_avhrr. 

	* collocations/collocate_granule.m: Increase number of overlap checks from
	2 to 3: one overlap check when I have the primary data, but not the
	secondary. If only a small fraction of the primary granule actually
	contains data (as is often the case with collocations), we can refrain
	from reading many of the secondary granules. Use epoch field instead of
	buggy unify_time_axis.

	* time/unify_time_axis.m: Get rid of buggy function. Use epoch field
	instead.

	* time/dayofyear_inverse.m: Use simpler and faster approach. Convert to
	double to prevent rounding errors.

	* files/loadncvar.m: Rather than using a readattr argument, simply look at
	nargout te determine if the second output argument should be assigned.

	* datasets/common_read_collocation_cpr_mhs.m: Adapt to collocations that
	are now in NetCDF. Add version string and epoch field.

	* datasets/common_read_avhrr.m: Add version string and epoch field. Adapt
	to modernity. Use atmlab('WORK_AREA') rather than /tmp/.

	* datasets/datasets_constants.m: Include abbreviated satellite names so
	that amsub_or_mhs also works for N15, N16, etc.

	* datasets/TODO: TODO: add epoch fields to all reader functions.

	* ChangeLog: Document my changes.

2010-10-11	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-79

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Check for legacy calling signature.
	Issue a warning but proceed if this is the case.

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: Write trailing newline to
	atmlab('OUT') rather than always to stdout (fid 1).

2010-10-08	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-78

	* collocations/colloc_select_good_lines.m: Put back ugly special-case
	hack, I was too optimistic "don't need it any longer" when I removed it.

2010-10-08	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-77

	* collocations/colloc_constants.m: For POES/POES-data, I'm storing
	AMSU-B/MHS, not all of AMSU. Also fix dimensions.

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Bugfix: 0 is a valid varid, so
	cannot be used as a flag. Use -1 as a flag instead.

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: Don't define a dimension
	already defined before, rather just reuse it. Optionally define extra
	attributes to be stored.

	* math/combine_rows.m: Fix typo in helpstring.

	* datasets/datasets_config.m, site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Add
	'legacy' datasets (old-style collocations).  

	* datasets/common_read_avhrr.m: Update to split colloc_config.

	* ChangeLog: Document my changes


2010-10-08	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-76

	* datasets/datasets_config.m, site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Add 4
	more CloudSat CPR datasets and alias the old one to cloudsat_2B_CWC_RO.
	Also add docs on how to add new datasets.

	* collocations/colloc_process_poes_poes.m: Fix bug, called _mhs_mhs, not
	_poes_poes.

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: Fix bug, POES has no meandata.

	* datasets/README: Add note on where to find help for adding new datasets.

	* datasets/TODO: cleared two items that are DONE.

2010-10-08	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-75

	* site-specific/kiruna/datasets_init.m: Match either full path or just
	basename.

	* datasets/find_info_from_granule.m: Update documentation according to
	change in datasets_init

	* datasets/find_granules_by_date.m: Update call according to changed
	regexp in datasets_init.

2010-10-08	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-74

	* datasets/find_info_from_granule.m: Added: returns information about a
	granule based on its filename. E.g. the hour and the minute for a MHS
	granule, the year, day of your, hour and minute for a CloudSat CPR
	granule, etc. For more information, please read the help-text.

	* datasets/list_datasets.m: Added: return a list of all datasets that can
	be used in functions like find_info_from_granule, find_granules_by_date,
	etc.

	* handy/prstnt_struct.m: CHANGED BEHAVIOUR in case no arguments are
	passed. Instead of printing the structure to the screen, return its value.
	In theory, this can break existing code, but also in theory, any
	programmer eval-ing stuff written to the screen deserves crushing by
	elephant. In the new behaviour, the caller can actually find out fields
	that are valid. If this changed behaviour causes problems in well-designed
	code, please write to atmlab-dev@www.sat.ltu.se.

	* datasets/read_granule.m: Add a 'force' option: instead of raising an
	error, a failure in reading will give "just" a warning and return an empty
	array.

	* collocations/colloc_process_cpr_mhs.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_data_cpr_mhs.m: Don't crash if HIRS or AMSU-A
	missing or broken.

	* datasets/find_granules_by_date.m, datasets/find_granules_for_period.m,
	datasets/find_datafile_by_date.m, datasets/find_datadir_by_date.m,
	datasets/read_granule.m, datasets/find_info_from_granule.m: Advertise
	list_datasets here.

2010-10-08  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-73

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Throws a warning message if there are no
	directories for specified site (from atmlab('SITE') in atmlab_conf
	if configured). e.g. 'Kiruna' instead of 'kiruna'

2010-10-07  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-72
	
	* geoplots/gmt/makepolar.m (makepolar): accidentally left a 'keyboard'


2010-10-07  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-71

	* geoplots/gmt/polygoninize_regions.m (polygoninize_regions):
	Small changes. This function is for plotting lines (e.g. for
	region boundaries) using GMT.

	* geoplots/gmt/makepolar.m: Completely overhauled. Manually
	generates .cpt-file where contours less than a reference value
	(e.g. in.reference=0 for difference plots) are blue and contours
	for values higher than reference are red. Contours around the
	reference values are white. Smooth transition of colors even if
	the reference value is no where near the middle.

	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: Cleaned up and commented.

	* geoplots/gmt/equidistant_contours.m: Cleaned up and commented.

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Updated help section for difference plots

	* datasets/find_granules_by_date.m: If no regexp, look for exact match
	  based on filename and string replacement.
	
	* (various): Set $Id$ tag.

2010-07-07	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-69

	* collocations/collocate_date.m: Less confusing logging.

	  fully  by find_datafile_by_date
	
	* collocations/collocation_read.m, collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Move fully to NetCDF, will temporarily
	  break reading other kinds of collocations.

	replace_aliases.

	* collocations/overlap_granule.m: Adapt for split colloc_config

2010-10-07	Bengt Rydberg	<bengt.rydberg@alumn.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-67

	* arts/scenegen/: updated asg (atmospheric state generator)

2010-10-06	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-66

	* datasets/: Directory added with some new content, but mostly moved from
	  elsewhere.

	* The Big Move:
	  collocations/find_granules_by_date.m, handy/find_datafile_by_date.m,
	  handy/find_granules_for_period.m, handy/amsub_or_mhs.m,
	  sensors/read_granule.m, sensors/granule_first_line.m,
	  handy/find_datafile_by_date.m, sensors/read_granule.m
	  --> datasets/

	  collocations/colloc_read_* -> datasets/common_read_*
	  collocations/colloc_read_cpr.m -> datasets/common_read_cpr_2BCWCRO.m

	* collocations/colloc_get_filename_hirscs.m: Deleted, treated by revised
	  datasets/find_datafile_by_date.m

	* collocations/colloc_config.m, collocations/colloc_constants.m,
	  datasets/datasets_config.m, datasets/datasets_constants.m: Split
	  collocations/colloc_config.m in 4, trying to fit all where it best
	  belongs.

	* site-specific, /kiruna, /datasets_init.m: Started a site-specific
	  directory along with a site-specific Kiruna initialisation with
	  constants for the datasets.

	* handy/alias.m: Added. Define aliases.

	* handy/strrep_multi.m: Added. Multi-string replacement.

	* datasets/strrep_variables.m: Added. Replaces particular strings. Here
	rather than in handy/ because it's so specific.

	* datasets/find_datadir_by_date.m: Split off code from
	  find_datafile_by_date, is this is also useful for find_granules_by_date.

	* datasets/README: Start README for this section. To be expanded.

	* datasets/TODO: Start TODO for this section. To be expanded.

	* datasets/find_granules_by_date.m, datasets/find_datafile_by_date.m:
  	  Complete rewrite, more flexible approach, no more need for get_filename_* etc.
	  Latter can also return non-existing (to-be-written) paths.

	* datasets/common_read_poes_radiometer.m: Assert monotonically increasing
	time-axes. Was causing problems when locating meandata.
	
	* collocations/colloc_process_data_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m,

	* collocations/collocation_read.m,
	collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m,
	collocations/collocate_and_store_date.m
	  Added note: needs rewrite after todays mayhem.

	* collocations/collocate_granule.m: Check for invalid data.

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Added OUT and ERR options, to redirect logging.

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Added directory for datasets. Resort paths
	anti-alphabetical. Added framework for SITE: in the site-directory, any
	_init will be executed after atmlab_init.m.

	* datasets/read_granule.m: Don't flood screen with logging.

	* ChangeLog: Documented my changes, including this on.
	

2010-10-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-65

	* handy/rqre_nargin.m: Header text described another function.
	(Gerrit: I made this set of functions to make the input checks
	more compact. nargchk is more advanced than this function, but as
	it just returns an error message, you need an if statement etc. in
	the calling function. With this function, you just need one line
	of code.)

	* gformat/gf_set.m: gf_set fields was set incorrectly.

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: atmlab('defaults') now called only if no
	atmlab_conf found.

	* math/getdims.m: Removed demand that A has to be numeric.
	Unesseary limitation.

2010-01-06	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-64

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: Don't crash if there is no
	  meandata. There may actually be no meandata if all occasions with
	  B_DIST<7.5 km have flagged values for ROIWP, as happens for collocations
	  with NOAA-16 on 18 January 2008.

2010-01-06	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-63

	* collocations/colloc_process_meandata_cpr_mhs.m,
	  collocations/colloc_process_meandata_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m: Fixed
	  bug. The bug was caused by using length(foo) instead of size(foo, 1),
	  causing a bug if the number of averaged collocations would be less than
	  the number of fields that I was unique-ing on, in this case 2. This is
	  rare, but happened for CloudSat-CPR 2008-01-12 04:58 with NOAA-15 AMSU-B
	  2008-01-12 04:28.

2010-01-05	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-62
	
	* handy/find_datafile_by_date.m: Can specify a tolerance in seconds if the
	  starting date/time is not exact. Use case: MSPPS granules may start a
	  minute /after/ the corresponding AMSU granule. Highly annoying, but with
	  by specifying a sufficiently large tolerance one can now still use the
	  AMSU starting time to locate the MSPPS granule.

	* collocations/colloc_process_data_cpr_mhs.m: Use the tolerance as
	  described above. Assert that MSPPS should have the same number of rows
	  as AMSU. If not, ignore the entire granule. I store things by
	  row-number, so if MSPPS is larger or smaller due to one extra or missing
	  row, I risk getting the wrong data everywhere.

2010-01-05	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-61

	* collocations/colloc_concatenate_colloc_data_mean.m: Fixed bug,
	difference between any(foo) and any(foo(:), 'if any(foo)' is actually 'if
	all(any(foo))'; this led to bugs when concatenating structures with very
	few averaged collocations (those would be considered to be 0).

2010-01-05	Gerrit Holl <gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-60

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Catch error if file cannot be
	gunzipped.

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Use atmlab('WORK_AREA') rather
	than '/tmp/'

	* collocations/overlap_granule.m: Do not add a column with satellite
	numbers. This is bug-prone and not generic.

	* sensors/cloudsat_read_zipped.m: Use atmlab('WORK_AREA') rather than
	tempdir.

	* sensors/granule_first_line.m: Add a bit more documentation on what
	should or shouldn't happen.

2010-01-05	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-59
	
	* collocations/find_granules_by_date.m: Also return filename list.

2010-01-04	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-58

	* collocations/colloc_concatenate_colloc_data_mean.m: Include data
	versions.

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Always gzipped, simpler approach
	to ignoring numbers, 

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: Always gzipped, include data
	versions, put rows first in multi-column data.

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Always gzipped.

	* collocations/collocate_granule.m: Include versions.


2010-01-04	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-57

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: NetCDF should be gzipped

	* collocations/colloc_read_poes_radiometer.m, colloc_read_cpr: Add path
	and version for data.

	* collocations/find_granules_by_date.m: Raise error if basedir not found.

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Add support for reading only
	particular columns. Add warning that this is in transition. NetCDF should
	be gzipped.

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: NetCDF should be gzipped.

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Add aliases MHS = AMSU(16:20) and more.

	* collocations/colloc_read_cpr.m: Add path and version for data.
	
2010-01-04	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>


	* atmlab-1-0-56

	* sensors/cloudsat_read.m: Can now return global attributes. Note: IMHO
	this function can use some improval, it's slightly messy at places.

2010-10-01	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-55

	* math/combine_rows.m: Added. Returns matrix with all combinations of rows
	from all arguments.

	* handy/struct2string_compact.m: Added. Returns compact string
	representation of scalar structure (all values must be scalar numbers).

2010-09-24	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-54

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Temporary hack to check whether we're
	doing NetCDF or not

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Start implementing NetCDF
	reading.

	* handy/structsearch.m: Return the first if only one is found.

	* ChangeLog: Add my own AND Ole's previous one, as Ole forgot to commit
	his ChaneLog (but fortunately it was on the SVN-list :P)

2010-09-24  Ole Martin Christensen  <olem@chalmers.se>

    * atmlab-1-0-53

    * geophysics/profile2column.m: Function for calculating the column
      values given retrived profile(s)

2010-09-24	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-52

	* collocations/colloc_get_path_cpr_poes_radiometer.m: Transition to
	NetCDF: function can return either the new style (nc) or old style
	(colloc/data/mean) collocation files.

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Fix bug occuring in case one
	requests data columns, but no overlap columns.

	* collocations/write_collocations_netcdf.m: Transition to NetCDF: function
	to write collocations to NetCDF. Only tested for CloudSat so far. Will be
	merged into write_collocations at a later date.

	* collocations/collocate_and_store_date.m: Use write_collocations_netcdf.

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Move firstline-granules default location
	away from my own home-directory. Transition to NetCDF, add 'stored style'
	field to cols_cpr_poes

	* collocations/collocation_read_dual.m: Disable this function as it's
	currently not working, due to the removal, by default, of lines by
	collocation_read, in order to prevent doubles.

	* collocations/colloc_process_meandata_cpr_mhs.m: Fix bug: CV was
	inversely defined!

2010-09-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-51

	* gridcreation/gridconvert.m: Updated input checks. 

	* gridcreation/grid_weightspaced.m: Created.

2010-09-16  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-50

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m (gmt_plot): Took care of annoying demand
	that fieldnames 'lat' and 'lon' must be included arguments. Now
	excepts 'lat', 'Latitude', 'latitude','lon',' Longitude',
	'longitude', 'long' as structure field names. This is nice so that
	I can plot data directly from swaths using the geo-fieldnames,
	which were used to read the geo-data.

2010-09-14  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-49
	
	* math/binning_fast.m: Error in help section

	* geoplots/gmt/polygoninize_regions.m: Better help section 

2010-09-13  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-48
	
	* time/dayofyear_inverse.m: Added function that is the opposite of
	dayofyear, i.e. if you have the day of year and want the month
	and day.

	* geoplots/gmt/polygoninize_regions.m: Added function that outputs
	the necessary arguments for plotting regions with GMT, e.g. used
	in wrapper function plot_empty_regions.m. This function is
	especially useful for plotting region outlines on top of data
	plotted with GMT.

	* geoplots/gmt/plot_empty_regions.m: Added function that display
	the outline of regions on an empty map using GMT. The only
	manditory argument are the coordinates for the regions. The
	function is especially useful in that it can handle composite
	regions, i.e. made up of many rectangular regions next to each
	other.
	

2010-09-10  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-47

	* files/whichfiles.m: Output argumement was not set if folder just
	contains folders. 

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m (atmlab_init): The folder V7-4 is now added
	to the search path, if the the version is < 7.4. This is a
	different way to handle backward compatibility than the old,
	removed, system.

	* V7-4: Created this folder.
	
	* V7-4/assert.m (assert): Added this function by Gerald Dalley,
	taken from Matlab Central.

2010-09-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-46

	* arts/arts_poslos2cart.m: Changed 89.99 to 89.9999, to be
	consistent with arts. (Used hours to find what I assumed was a
	problem in arts!)

2010-09-06	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-45

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Extend documentation.

2010-09-06	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-44

	* collocations/colloc_process_poes_poes.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_data_cpr_mhs.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_cpr_mhs.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_cpr_avhrr.m, collocations/collocate_granule.m: Remove doubles after
	processing, but not on reading, because the row numbers will be wrong.

	* collocations/colloc_process_data_cpr_mhs.m: Do not remove doubles on
	reading, because the row-numbers will be incorrect.

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Always get rid of doubles. The opposite
	is temporarily impossible, it is extremely unlikely that is what you want.
	Will add data fields required to find doubles to output.

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Add a field to indicate what columns to
	pass on to the double-removing filter.

	* collocations/collocation_restrain.m: Catch error if filter fails.

	* sensors/read_granule.m: Optionally keep doubles. This is what you want
	prior to collocations, otherwise finding the original data is tricky, as
	row-numbers will be screwed up.


2010-09-06  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-43

	* math/taylor_diagram.m (taylor_diagram): Added script to create
	the infamous Taylor diagram. It is used to visualize (on a
	circular plot) the inter-comparison of datasets compared to a
	reference data set in terms of STD, RMSD and correlation. See:
	" K. Taylor , Summarizing multiple aspects of model performance in
	a single diagram Journal of Geophysical % Research-Atmospheres,
	2001, V106, D7. " for further details

	* collocations/colloc_process_data_cpr_mhs.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_cpr_mhs.m,
	collocations/collocate_granule.m: Use read_granule to read granule.

	* collocations/colloc_select_good_lines.m: Correct for +1-second wart here instead of
	in granule_first_line. Still horrid, though.

	* sensors/read_granule.m: Use some fancy magic to get rid of double
	scanlines.

	* sensors/granule_first_line.m: Move compensation for ugly +1-second wart
	from here to collocations/colloc_select_good_lines.m where it is very

	* atmlab-1-0-29

	* math/binned_statistics.m:

	Turn off divideByZero warning. It will be shown calculating mean for
	empty bins. We can ignore the warning because the result is still what
	we want and in 2010a and later the warning is not displayed anyway.

2010-07-29	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-26

2010-07-28	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-26

	* collocations/limstruct2limmat.m: Added. Convert limits structure to

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Use new limstruct2limmat function.

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Add links, used by collocation_read_dual

	* collocations/collocation_read_dual.m: Simplify the format, read
	secondary stuff from colloc_config rather than having it somewhat
	redundantly passed on. Added support for limits on secondary pair. 

2010-07-27	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-25

	* collocations/collocation_read_dual.m: Added. This function is for "dual
	reading": for example, read collocated-data/AVHRR-collocations, and from
	the 'pointers' in this one, read corresponding lines from
	CPR/MHS-meandata. This function is in early development and will change
	significantly.

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Don't crash on empty limits-struct.

	* collocations/colloc_read_collocation_cpr_poes.m: Actually read the
	meandata file, even when the collocations file is given as an argument. Or
	actually read both, to get unique MHS pixels but only there where averages
	were taken. Needed for application with
	collocated-data/AVHRR-collocations, but not very pretty to have it here.
	To be thought through later...

	* collocations/TODO: Added entry to wish for a better solution to the
	problem solved uglily as mentioned in the Changelog entry above.

2010-07-27	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-25

	meandata, so that CloudSat/MHS or collocated-data/AVHRR can be read again.

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Check for emptiness before
	proceeding with data and mean, because the latter crashes on emptiness.

	* collocations/collocate_granule.m: try/catch around reading primary, and
	check for emptiness

	* time/unify_time_axis.m, time/compensate_wraparound.m,
	time/find_common_time.m: Check for emptiness.

2010-07-26	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-24

	* collocations/colloc_concatenate_colloc_data_mean.m: Fix bug introduced
	when the "get rid of doubles" feature was added; failed when there was no
	data in the first place.

2010-07-23	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-23

	* collocations/colloc_read_collocation_cpr_poes.m: Add support for reading
	collocations from the make-new-collocations pov to facilitate collocations
	between cpr-poes-collocations and avhrr.

	* collocations/colloc_process_*_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m,
	collocations/colloc_get_path_collocation_cpr_poes_avhrr.m: Add support for
	collocations between cpr-poes-collocations and avhrr.

	* collocations/colloc_concatenate_colloc_data_mean.m: Bugfix: only
	concatenate data if there is any.

	* collocations/find_granules_by_date.m: If no regexp exist, just return
	the date (one granule per day).

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Add support for collocations between
	cpr-poes-collocations and avhrr. 

	* collocations/README: Fix numbering.

	* collocations/TODO: Add note on fixing doubles with meandata (this makes
	the aforementioned new feature still partly unuseable) and wish limiting
	collocations to 1 of the smaller ones (e.g. CPR collocates only with at
	most one MHS)

	* collocations/colloc_process_hirscs_poes.m: Fix documentation errors.

	* handy/find_datafile_by_date.m: Add support for cases where files are
	stored per day and only one file per day, with foo_filename. This
	facilitates finding the collocation files mentioned above.

2010-07-22	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

2010-07-08	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-20

	* collocations/colloc_read_hirscs.m: Check for doubles and return only one
	copy of each double. Also rotate bt and lc fields to be more consistent.

	* collocations/colloc_process_data_hirscs_poes.m: Adapt for rotated bt and
	lc fields.

2010-07-08	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-19
	
	* collocations/collocate_date.m: When collocating a particular date, do
	this a bit more nicely than just taking all granules starting on this
	date. Instead, collocate all granules containing any data for this date,
	and then cut off those collocations that are outside the date boundary,
	for the primary satellite.

	* collocations/colloc_concatenate_colloc_data_mean.m: Raise an error when
	trying to use the not-implemented feature.

	* collocations/find_granules_by_date.m: To assist collocate_date, also
	return yesterdays last granule, as this also covers something for the
	date. If available, that is.

	* collocations/overlap_granule.m, handy/find_datafile_by_date.m:
	Adapt for changed default behaviour for find_granules_by_date

	* collocation/collocate_granule: To assist collocate_date, add a flag
	forcing it to return only collocations on the same day as either the start
	or the end of the first granule.

2010-07-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-18

	* math/average_bins2.m: Complete rewrite to make it more flexible.

2010-07-08	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-17

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Add additional error check in exception
	handling.

	* collocations/colloc_concatenate_colloc_data_mean.m: When concatenating
	data, get rid of doubles. Now takes additional 'unicol' argument that
	determines what columns in the data are used to identify whether a
	collocation is a repetition of a previous one (should be something like
	lat1/long1/time1/lat2/long2/time2).

	* handy/unique2.m: Return those rows in second matrix not occuring in the
	first matrix (as a logical).

	* collocations/collocate_date.m, collocations/collocate_granule.m: Adapt for new
	colloc_concatenate_colloc_data_mean; pass on unicol argument.

	* collocations/colloc_config.m, collocations/README: add unicol to 'cols'
	structures.

	* collocations/find_granules_by_date.m: Fix error in docstring.

2010-07-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-16

	* math/average_bins2.m:

	Temporarely added this function to calculate additional properties
	like median and standard deviation. Should be merged later with
	average_bins. I didn't want to touch Salomon's original function
	because I'm not sure why it uses three loops instead of two which
	makes calculating the mean and std hard.

2010-07-07  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-15

	* gridcreation/profile_refine.m: Renamed delta to delta_ln_p to
	make it more obvious that it is in ln units. Also added a check
	that the value is below 10. (An ln(Pa) of 10 correspons roughly to
	an altitude difference of 70 km.)

2010-07-06  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-1-0-14

	* files/getncattributes.m:

	Function to get global attributes from NetCDF file.

	* files/addncattributes.m:

	Function to add global attributes to a NetCDF file.

	* arts/netcdf/arts_nc_write_*: Add support for global attributes.

2010-07-02  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-12

	* gridcreation/profile_refine.m: Added. Uses grid_refine to
	interpolate a set of atmospheric profiles to a finer vertical
	grid. Interpolation is done linerly in ln(p), as usual in
	arts. This is intended for the interpolation of radiosonde data to
	a finer vertical grid for RT simulation.

	* gridcreation/grid_refine.m: Added. Refines a grid by adding
	additional points, so that the spacing everywhere is smaller than
	the desired delta. Retains the points of the original grid.

2010-07-01  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-11

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m (gmt_plot): Fixed so that datarange.max
	can be given without datarange.min and visa versa.

2010-06-24	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-10

	* collocations/colloc_get_filename_hirscs.m: Fix bug in test if file is
	gzipped or not.

	* collocations/collocate_date.m, collocations/collocate_and_store_date.m,
	collocations/collocate_granule.m:
	If nothing successful, don't write a thing

	* collocations/colloc_read_hirscs.m: convert to double, was losing
	precision in unixtime (precision with single there only 30 seconds)

	* collocations/README: Added jumpstart

	* collocations/TODO: Reorganised

	* time/find_common_time.m: Fix bug occuring when time is not increasing
	all the time. Bug occured with hirscs because time jumps back and forth;
	correction was not done OK.

	* handy/structsearch.m: Give more helpful error message if invalid field
	is requested.

2010-06-23	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-9

	* collocations/colloc_process_poes_poes.m: Fix error in documentation.

	* collocations/colloc_get_filename_hirscs.m: For HIRS-CS, data are not
	stored per day, so instead of configuration a regexp in colloc_config,
	need to use a deditacted file for this special case.

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Fix error in documentation. Add newline
	to warning message. Output a notice in case of no collocations. Support
	input {'a', 'cell', 'string'} rather than {{'like', 'this'}} if only
	geometrical information is requested.

	* collocations/colloc_concatenate_colloc_data_mean.m: Don't crash on
	fields occuring in the "base" but not in the "new" structure.

	* collocations/find_granules_by_date.m: Add support for "special cases",
	if there is no yeardir, just return the date, and add support for regexps
	not giving the hour and the minute as named matches.

	* collocations/colloc_read_avhrr.m: Fix error in documentation.

	* collocations/colloc_read_hirscs.m: Add support for HIRS-CS. Sometimes
	gzipped, but sometimes not!

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Add support for HIRS-CS/MHS-collocations.

	* collocations/collocate_and_store_date.m: Try to check for existance of
	destination files also if collocation with 'poes'. Ideally should
	collocate only those that don't exist yet, but this implementation simply
	uses any(exist).

	* collocations/README: Expand: Add some warning messages, add supported
	collocation pairs, add a summary on adding a pair, document the new
	alternate method for get_filename, add config. about how long a granule
	takes.

	* collocations/colloc_get_path_hirscs_poes_radiometer.m: Get the path for
	collocated HIRSCS/POES-collocations.

	* collocations/colloc_process_hirscs_poes.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_data_hirscs_poes.m: Add support for
	HIRS-CS/MHS-collocations. Special thing here: only the closest one to
	HIRS.

	* collocations/collocate_granule.m: Add a(n) (unfortunately ugly) hack for
	the special case 'poes' because of the different names for amsub/mhs.
	Also, only correct time axis if satellites did indeed start on different
	dates, and keep the old time axis.

	* handy/find_datafile_by_date.m: If datafiles are not stored per day,
	needs a special function to answer this question.

	CPR/AVHRR-collocations.

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Add support for CPR/AVHRR, fix typo.

	* collocations/collocate_granule.m: Don't assume AMSUB/MHS, should also
	work for AVHRR.

	* handy/find_datafile_by_date.m: Get rid of commented-out previous
	implementation.

	* collocations/README: Add information on how to add the location of the
	actual source files (duh!).

2010-06-18	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>
	
	* atmlab-1-0-5

	* collocations/colloc_colname2no.m: Convert column names to column
	numbers, used when reading collocations, because one can refer to columns
	by name (B_LAT, C_LAT, B_DIST, etc.).

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Add aliases for the POES sensors and
	satellites to 'poes', so that it's not needed to add all different
	combinations of not only mhs/amsub, but also (shudder)
	noaa15–noaa19+metopa. Renamed mhs-thingies to poes.

	* collocations/collocation_read.m: Use this function to read earlier
	written collocations.

	* collocations/collocate_date.m: Added a FIXME to remind me of something
	on my TODO-list.

	* collocations/README: Add info on how to set up the configuration, how to
	read previously collocated collocations with collocation_read, updated
	information on how to add code for a new pair of collocations.

	* collocations/TODO: Added most important TODO-items.

	* collocations/collocation_restrain.m: Limit collocations (or actually any
	matrix) to certain ranges (such as latitude within [-20 20]).

	* collocations/read_collocs_data_mean.m: Helper function for
	collocation_read, particularly with the meandata that has smaller
	dimensions and pointers to the other two.

	* handy/structsearch.m: Search in a structure recursively. Used by
	colloc_colname2no.

2010-06-18	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-4

	* handy/prstnt_struct.m: If a field is not defined, generate a *useful*
	exception, e.g, one that can be checked when catched. So make a meaningful
	errorid and add the missing field to the error string. I think this should
	not break anything, but in theory it could break poorly designed code.

	* collocations/README: Add more information on how to find collocations,
	but particularly, add documentation on how to add code for a new pair of
	collocations.

	* collocations/colloc_get_path_poes_poes.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_poes_poes.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_data_poes_poes.m,
	collocations/colloc_config.m: Add support for poes/poes-collocations.

	* collocations/collocate_and_store_date.m,
	collocations/collocate_granule.m: Consider number of outputs.

	* collocations/collocate_date.m: Catch for renamed error identifiers.

2010-06-17	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>
	
	* atmlab-1-0-3

	* collocations/overlap_granule.m: Sort output from find_granules_by_date,
	granules are not always ordered sequentially on the disc.

	* collocations/colloc_get_path_cpr_poes_radiometer.m: Determine the full
	path of the files to which CloudSat-MHS collocations for the given date
	and satellite should be written. Needs configuration (see online help).

	* collocations/colloc_config.m: Add configuration as needed by
	colloc_get_path_cpr_poes_radiometer.m,

	* collocations/collocate_and_store_date.m: For a given date, check whether
	a collocation datafile exists. If it doesn't (or cscol('overwrite') is
	set), collocate the indicated satellites and sensors with each other and
	store the result in the appropiate datafile. Needs configuration (see
	online help).

	* collocations/collocate_date.m: This m-file collects all collocations for
	the given date between the indicated sensor pairs and returns the result
	in a structure. Needs configuration (see online help).

	* collocations/README: Beginning of documentation.

	* collocations/write_collocations.m: Write collocation data for
	year/month/day in structure S to a filename. The filename is determined
	from the satellite and sensors used. Needs configuration (see online
	help).

	* time/daterange.m: Return a range of dates, as a matrix.

2010-06-17	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>
	
	* atmlab-1-0-2

    * collocations/collocate_granule.m: Given a pair of satellite/sensor
	(sat1, sensor1, sat2, sensor2) and a starting time for a granule for the
	first satellite/sensor pair (as a datevec), collocate the
	sat1/sensor1-granule with /all/ sat2/sensor2-granules that have overlap
	+/- the collocation interval time.
	Depends on appropiate settings in colloc_config and on:
	+ overlap_granule
	+ find_datafile_by_date
	+ colloc_read_*
	+ colloc_process_*
	+ colloc_concatenate_colloc_data_mean
	+ unify_time_axis
	+ find_common_time
	+ collocate
	+ amsub_or_mhs
	+ logtext

    * collocations/overlap_granule.m: Given a pair of satellite/sensor (sat1,
	sensor1, sat2, sensor2) and a starting time for a granule for the first
	satellite/sensor pair (as a datevec), give the starting times for all
	granules from sat2/sensor2 that have a time overlap +/- the collocation
	interval time. Used by collocate_granule. Depends on appropiate settings
	in colloc_config and on:
    + find_granules_by_date
    + amsub_or_mhs

    * collocations/find_granules_by_date.m: Given a satellite/sensor pair and
	a date, gives the starting times for all granules for this
	satellite/sensor pair for this date. Depends on appropiate settings in
	colloc_config.

    * collocations/colloc_read_poes_radiometer.m,
	collocations/colloc_read_cpr.m: Wrappers around well-established read
	functions for data, but return data in a common format so that the caller,
	in this case collocate_granule, can determine the names to call
	dynamically, with the help of colloc_config, and doesn't need to know how
	to process or to call a processing function, thus reducing the need for
	long switch-statements. Depends on appropiate settings in colloc_config
	and on compensate_wraparound.

	* collocations/colloc_process_cpr_mhs.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_data_cpr_mhs.m,
	collocations/colloc_process_meandata_cpr_mhs.m: After collocate_granule
	has read data (colloc_read_*), found what to collocate it with
	(overlap_granule) and collocated it (collocate), use those three (up to
	three) functions to gather interesting information to store. Depend on
	find_datafile_by_date and appropiate settings in colloc_config.

    * collocations/colloc_config.m: This function, in the style of 'atmlab',
	contains configurations, constants and globals (at least that's how I use
	them) used throughout my collocation code and a bit beyond. Currently
	contains defaults applicable to the SAT-cluster, but it should be
	generically configurable.

    * collocations/colloc_concatenate_colloc_data_mean.m: Specialised helper
	function needed to concatenate different outputs of overlap_granule. See
	source code for detailed rationale.

    * sensors/cloudsat_read_zipped.m: Unzip, read and remove unzipped CS.

    * time/compensate_wraparound.m: AMSU stores time in (milli)seconds since
	00:00 UT, if an orbit crosses the UT date boundary, this reduces to 0.
	That makes it hard to compare times, so this compensates for it.

    * time/unify_time_axis.m: For two different time vectors, correct at most
	one of them so that their epoch will be common. In particular, if two
	satellite datasets store time as "time since 00:00 UT", they might start
	on subsequent dates and one of them should be corrected for them to be
	compared. Used by collocate_granule.

    * time/find_common_time.m: For two time vectors (or actually, can be done
	for any vector), mark the parts covered by both, +/- an interval.
	Used by collocate_granule.

    * handy/logtext.m: Log text along with callers filename and line-number.
	If the output is the Matlab desktop, also make links.

    * handy/amsub_or_mhs.m: Which sensor is on this satellite? Depends on
	appropiate settings in colloc_config.

    * handy/find_datafile_by_date.m: Given a satellite-sensor-pair and a
	starting date/time for a granule, return the filename containing data. See
	also find_granules_by_date. Depends on appropiate settings in
	colloc_config.

2010-06-16	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-1

	* collocations/collocate.m: Added function collocate.m to collocate data
	between two matrices. I will add higher-level functions later that
	collocate between satellite datasets for time periods, as well as
	functions to easily read (selected parts of) such collocations for a given
	time period.

	* AUTHORS: Added myself.

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Added collocations/ directory.

	* README: Fixed e-mail addresses for Oliver and Stefan (irv.se has ceased
	to exist long ago and irv.de has AFAIK never existed at all).

	* ChangeLog: Documented changes made to various files.

2010-06-03  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-1-0-0

	* Declaring this as version 1.0. Mainly due to the
	polishing for the upcoming workshop, but also to indicate that
	the (few) common features of atmlab should be fixed and that most
	functions should be stable.

2010-06-02  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-86
	
	* math/average_bins.m : Added function
	AVERAGE_BINS returns grid averages, sum, and numel from a cell of
	gridded data. e.g. from binning_fast.

2010-05-30  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-86
	
	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: A better way  of determining if the
	data is gridded or not. Also allow gridded data to be either
	(lat,lon) or (lon,lat)

2010-05-27  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-85

	* files/loadncfile.m:
	Unfortunately had to remove '~'-wildcards ( used instead of
	creating function output variables which don't get used), because
	this is not compatible with the student version of MATLAB.

2010-05-26  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-84
	
	* math/binning_fast.m (binning_fast): spelling


2010-05-26  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-83
	
	* geoplots/gmt/create_gmt_earth.m: 
	Now automatically pick the increment and search radius for the
	data dependent on the approximate density of the data

	* geoplots/gmt/gmt_plot.m: Cleaned up a bit.
	
	* math/binning_fast.m:
	Adjusted code to allow for longitude ranges to be either in the
	-180:180 or 0:360 format.
	Also allow binning of user defined regions and not just global.
	Avoid crashes due to precision errors. 
	The function did not loose speed after this update and is
	backwards compatible.
	

2010-05-24  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-0-4-82

	* CONFIGURE: Fix paths.

2010-05-21	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-81

	* math/binning_fast: Realised my solution to the loss-of-precision error
	can potentially lead to different results from the previous method, but
	not yet sure how often this occurs in practice and whether the previous or
	the current one is actually correct. Chose instead to go the easy way out
	and cast to double, but this problem needs a more serious fix after
	discussion with Salomon.

2010-05-21	Gerrit Holl	<gerrit.holl@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-81

	* math/binning_fast: Fix missing ) surreptitiously creeping up between

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (add_readfile): Handling of NetCDF added
	(but only for data already in such a file).

	* arts/netcdf/arts_nc_write_xxx.m: The variable v was missing in
	the header format string (for all write functions).

	* arts/qarts_abstable.m: The variations for non-linear species can
	now only be set in a direct manner. *dnls* must now give the

	behind

2010-03-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-63

	* demos/data: Removed the two example CloudSat files. The case
	using the files is not working, and the files have together a size
	of >200 Mb.

2010-03-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-62

	* demos/qarts_scattering_demo.m: Top altitude of clouxbox limits
	moved up as older limit was found to cut the pnd field. 

	Found that DOIT and FOS gave more deviating results when making
	the cloud "thinner". That should not happen. Tested to change 
	C.METHOD_PRMTRS.SCAT_ZA_INTERP from linear to polynomial, and this
	was found to decrease the problem strongly. So the polynomial
	option is now used. The agreement between DOIT and FOS (for
	default pnd value) is now better than before. 
	
2010-03-23  Salomon Eliasson  <s.eliasson@ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-61
	
	* math/binning_fast.m: generalized for a 0:360 or -180:180 grid

	* atmlab-0-4-58

	* math/binning_fast.m: Put the H1-line in the same block of comments as
	the documentation, so that 'help binning_fast' gives anything useful.

2010-03-15  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-57

	* forwardmodel/di2planckTb.m: Created. So far just a test.

2010-02-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-30

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Started on support for FOS. 

	* demos/qarts_scattering_demo.m: Made lat and lon grids more
	dense. Old very coarse grid caused an inconsistency between 1D and
	3D cases. This seems to improve the consistency between MC and
	DOIT (1D) results (though not yet had time for a very detailed MC
	run).
	Added code to allow tests of FOS (with some stuff hard-coded).

	center the plot at any longitude. Added option in.nodata if you
	only want an empty map. e.g for locations and what not. Also fixed

2010-01-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-1

	* sensors: Not re-added.

	* Some empty sub-folders were still hanging around.
	
2010-01-04  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-4-0

	* README has been updated and read it. Some of the points below
	are described more in detail in that file.
	
	* Some more strict format rules have been introduced, for
	simplified checks of user input and to avoid possible loop-holes
	in the code. New rules:
	- A boolean or a flag signifies now a logical of size 1. That is, true
	or false. A scalar 0 or 1 is not the same. These are numbers. 
	- Strictly one dimensional (numerical) tensors shall now be column
	vectors. Grids are examples on such objects. 
	These rules are not yet applied everywhere, but try to adopt now
	to avoid future problems.

	* Has started the convention that lines including the comment %&%
	are different types of checks, that can be removed for operational
	applications (when everything is well tested). This to make it
	possible to add heavy checks, but still have the possibility to
	obtain highest possible calculation speed.

	* Note that a set of e.g. temperatures very well can be a row
	vector. This is just a matter of you decide to store the
	temperatures. In this case it is a matrix (with one row). For
	example, the temperature input to vmr2nd can be a row vector. On
	the other hand, if you would use temperature as the grid for some
	other variable, this grid is an one dimensional object.
	This issue is associated with:
	
	* The default size demand for function input is that all data have
	the same size or are scalars, in order to allow element-by-element
	math (such as .*). This follows the standard Matlab
	approach. However, this rule can normally only be followed for
	functions where all the input is numeric and goes into a single
	equation (such as vmr2nd). Exceptions are the numerous cases when
	some input is a flag or a data grid. For such cases, the header
	needs to describe type and size demands. See further README.

	* Folders have been renamed and moved. This is an attempt to sort
	the functions in a more clear way. For example, there is now a
	folder h2o/, having the sub-folders parametrisations/ (mainly
	Bengt's PSD functions) and thermodynamics/ (Isaac's functions).
	
	* Version fixes are removed. The few added functions should now be
	at hand for everybody. And this feature should be obsolete.

	* Everything associated with arts-1 is removed.

	* set_defaults.m: Is removed (used eval, which is not an
	OK solution). Replaced by optargs.
	* optargs.m: Replaces set_defaults.

	* The set of rqre_xxx functions has been revised. Type specific
	functions have been removed (such as rqre_scalar). All type
	checking should be handled by rqre_datatypes and rqre_alltypes.
	List of new functions below. Order of input arguments changed in
	some cases, for consistency reasons.

	* min_nargin is replaced by rqre_nargin.
 
	* Some new isxxx functions have been created (see below). ismatrix
	is removed.

	* meannan is removed. Caused confusion due to a similar function
	in the statistical toolbox. (And someone else removed stdnans).
	Probably best to do this explicetely, to know what exactly what
	you are doing.

	* The gformat is totally revised. In short, the D part is removed
	and there is a new set of functions. See some of demo scripts for
	example usage. The "sub-class" atmdata now defined.

	* Qarts: The scope of qarts has been extended. Before just pure
	forward model variables were treated (including jacobian
	calculations). Retrieval settings, such as Sx data, and L2 output
	fields can now also be specified. Qpack2 was before a layer above
	qarts. This can now be avoided and qpack2 is rather a "glue"
	between the Q, O, Y and L2 parts.

	The stuff of qartsJacobian is now part of the main Q. Maybe most
	important is that Q.ABS_SPECIES is now a structure. For example,
	Q.J.ABS_SPECIES.UNIT is now Q.ABS_SPECIES.UNIT. Q.ABS_SPECIES has
	the field TAG. This is a string array, that can be set in two
	ways, e.g.: 
	   Q.ABS_SPECIES(1).TAG{1} = 'ClO'; 
	   Q.ABS_SPECIES(2).TAG    = { 'O3' };

	* arts/scenegen: Not yet updated.

	* Qpack2: There is now no Qpack2 setting structure. You use now
	the qarts Q and oem O directly. The main task of qpack2 now is to
	transfer data from the measurement structure to Q. Works presently
	just for single spectrum observations, but planned to be more
	general. Documentation not yet completed.

	* Removed functions, outside the arts and gformat folders:
		mat2v6.m
		ismatrix.m
	        rqre_bool.m
	        rqre_char.m
	        rqre_scalar.m

	as ABS_SPECIES{1}='H2O,H2O-MPM89') inside qarts.

2009-10-23  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-90

	* retrieval/oem.m: Indexing was wrong when saving cost values in 
	"post part".

2009-10-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-89

	* retrieval/oem.m: Printing of cost values delayed to next iteration,
	when possible, to obtain fewer calls of arts.

2009-10-22  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-88

	  states
	
        * demos/asg2y_demo2.m: added a function/demo that can simulate
	  amsu and mhs measurements on atmospheric states generated

	file exchange site.

	* arts/arts_map_daa.m: Created.

	* arts/arts_zaaa2cart.m: Created.

	* arts/arts_cart2zaaa.m: Created.
	
	* The arts cart to sph/poslos functions are now all set to not be
	defined for r=0. There is no clear way to define za and aa for r=0,
	and it is best to avoid this case at all. Use the zaaa2cart function
	pair instead.

	* arts/arts_cart2sph.m (arts_cart2sph): Now an error if r=0. This gives
	the same behaviour for arts_cart2poslos.m as this function is used.

	* arts/arts_sph2cart.m (arts_sph2cart): As above.

	* arts/arts_poslos2cart.m (arts_poslos2cart): As above.
	
2009-09-18  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	used for antenna_response.

2009-09-11  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-77

	* retrieval/oem.m: Smoothing error was incorrect with
	sxnorm=1. Bug pointed out by Peter F. Still not sure why. Anyhow,
	back-normalisation now applied in a more systematic way (as late
	as possible) and everything seems to work.

	* retrieval/qpack2/qp2_oem.m: Removed. Should have been removed
	earlier. Code was moved to qpack2.

2009-09-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke(at)core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-0-3-76

	* xml/xmlLoad.m: Use WORK_AREA for gunzip.

	and modified old function especially their documentations

	* physics/thermodynamic/mixing_ratio.m
	replaced it with a new function

	* physics/thermodynamic/wet_bulb_temperature.m
	deleted this functions. The equation provided in the cloud physics book

2009-08-27  Bengt Rydberg  <bengt.rydberg@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-73

	* retrieval/oem.m: The problem of getting a poor conditional
	number when retrieval quantities differ strongly in magnitude has
	been solved in a general by the option O.sxnorm. :-)

	* atmlab-0-3-68

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m (cfile_Sensor): All Q.SENSOR_ XXX variables
	are now always loaded. Too complicated to have checks to figure
	out which varaibles that are needed. Anyhow old version did not
	work.

	* forwardmodel/gridcreation/gridthinning.m: Changed check from

	* atmlab-0-3-46

	* forwardmodel/gridcreation/annealing/find_best_freq_set_anneal.m:
	Added additional output variable h. This is a structure containing
	the history of the annealing run. It is useful for making plots of
	the convergence behaviour.

	* forwardmodel/gridcreation/annealing/loop_anneal.m: Added an
	extra element h to output structure R, to pass on the
	corresponding output argument of find_best_freq_set_anneal.

	* forwardmodel/gridcreation/annealing/weights.m: Normalize
	weights, so that sum for each channel is exactly one. (Weight sums
	were very close to one already before. Forcing them to be exactly

	variable n_incr, which species by how much the number of
	frequencies should be increased in each iteration. (Suggested
	value is the number of instrument channels, if you optimize for a
	multichannel instrument.) Also increased verbosity to 1, so that
	one can see what is going on for long slow jobs.

2008-10-17  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-31

	* Work in several functions to prepare for polynomial baseline fits.

2008-10-08  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-28
	
	* retrieval/gpack.m: Started. Something like a Qpack2, with just
	ground-based measurements as target. Some qpack features, such as
	generation of random data sets, will not be included. On the other
	hand, gpack will be designed to handle batch inversions and flexible
	input of climatology and a priori data.

	* forwardmodel/gformat/clmtlgy_define.m: Created.

	* forwardmodel/gformat/clmtlgy_interp.m: Created.

	* forwardmodel/gformat/gf_check.m: Grid data are now allowed to be
	undefined for non-active dimensions.

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Q.ABS_LINESHAPE and Q.ABS_LINESHAPE_FACTOR
	not handled properly.

	* retrieval/oem.m: Some variables were not renamed properly.

2008-10-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-27

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: addpath not removed for all moved folders.

2008-10-07  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

2008-10-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-24

	* demos/arts_oem_demo.m: Some polishing. The demo works now again.

	* retrieval/oem.m: Screen+file output and selection of output
	variables now works as specified. Linear and Gauss-Newton
	solutions handled at this point.

	* handy/out.m: fid can now be [] (for zero verbosity).

2008-10-06  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* gformat/gf_append.m (gf_append): 
	* gformat/gfin_artsxml.m (gfin_artsxml): 
	* gformat/gfout_artsxml.m (gfout_artsxml): Added call of gf_check. 

	* gformat/gf_check.m: Created. 

	* gformat/gfout_artsxml.m (gfout_artsxml): Storage of length(G)==1 did
	not work.

2008-09-29  Gerrit Holl  <gerrit.holl@gmail.com>

	* atmlab-0-3-21

	* atovs/zamsu2llc.sh:

	This file was an old version. A newer version exists in
	atovs_tools/shell_scripts/zamsu2l1c.sh. I moved the never version here.
	This is not ideal (there should be one and only one version) but for now
	it's better than someone else getting the same confusion that I did.

2008-09-25  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-20

	* Made interface functions between gformat and xml GriddedField files.
	
	* gformat/gfout_artsxml.m: Created

	* gformat/gfin_artsxml.m: Created.

	* gformat/gfxmlin_GriddedField3.m: Replaced with more general
	function gfin_artsxml.
	
	* gformat/gf_append.m: Created.

2008-09-25  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-0-3-19

	* xml/xmlReadAttributes.m:

	Use s=[s c] instead of s=strcat(s,c) to append a character to a String
	because the latter removes spaces. Are you kidding me, Matlab?

2008-09-25  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-18

        * annealing: Added this directory, which contains a function
	package to optimize frequency grid by simulated annealing. The
	only inputs used are a batch of monochromatic brightness
	temperatures, and a sensor response matrix, so the functions are
	fairly general.
	
        * annealing/Contents.m: Added.
	
        * annealing/neighbour.m: Added. Pick a random neighbor to the
	current selection.
	
        * annealing/pick_random_freq.m: Added. Pick a random frequency.
	
        * annealing/test_freq_set.m: Added. Test calculation of given
	frequency selection.
	
        * annealing/weights.m: Added. Calculates weights for selected
	frequencies by linear regression.
	
        * annealing/find_best_freq_set_anneal.m. Added. This is the main
	annealing function. It finds the best set of N frequencies, where
	N is fix.
	
        * annealing/loop_anneal.m: Added. This is a higher level function,
	that loops over find_best_freq_set_anneal, increasing the number
	of frequencies until the desired accuracy is reached. For a single
	HIRS channel, 7 frequencies gave an accuracy of 0.007 K.

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Added directory annealing.

2008-09-24  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-17

	* arts/arts_absmodels.cfile: File updated to ARTS2 cfile format.

	* arts/qarts.m: Q.ABS_LINES_FORMAT can now be set to None. This is
	now the way to trigger a call of abs_lines_per_speciesSetEmpty. If
	this field is left empty ({}) nothing is done. It is then assumed
	that line data are specified in an include file.

	Replaced PRE_RTE_WSMS with WSMS_BEFORE_RTE. Added WSMS_AT_START
	and WSMS_AT_END. This to allow more flexibility. The approach
	before was to only handle "standard cases" in qarts, but as arts
	has become more flexible that approach was abandoned for
	arts-0.3. I now found that these fields are needed to make it
	possible to use the full flexibility of arts (though there could
	still be some limitations).
	
2008-09-23  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-16

	* graphs/histout2plotvecs.m: Added this function. It converts the
	output of matlab's hist command to two vectors that can be plotted
	with plot.
	This function is handy to make histogram plots where only the top
	contour is shown, not the bars.  In that style, several histograms
	can be plotted in one graph.
	The trick is that we are not just connecting the histogram points
	by a straight line, but we plot little stairs corresponding to the
	histogram bins.

2008-09-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-15

	* tests/make_check.m: Now updated and slightly extended. Now
	checks that qarts_demo, qarts_demo2, qarts_scattering_demo (MC and
	DOIT version) and qarts1_demo run OK and result is as expected.
	
	* demos/qarts1_demo.m: Now using lines501.4_v1

	* demos/data/lines501.4_v1: Copy of lines501.4, but in old format.

2008-09-12  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-14

2008-09-04  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-13

	* math/rms.m (rms): Added. Calculates RMS of a vector or matrix
	(always scalar return, but that may be changed).

	* arts/optimize_f_grid_hirs.m (optimize_f_grid_hirs): Added. Not
	yet tested properly. 

	* arts/optimize_f_grid_amsu.m (optimize_f_grid_amsu): Added. Used
	to derive a reduced frequency grid for AMSU, now included in
	amsub_fast.arts in arts includes directory.

2008-08-20  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-12

	* Qarts updated to changes in arts, but work not finished. Gformat
	and asg functions matching GFields are not yet updated.

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Adjusted to introduction of y_f, y_pos, mc_std_err
	etc. in arts.

	* arts/arts_y.m: Adjusted to introduction of y_f, y_pos etc. in arts. 

	* demos/qarts_scattering_demo.m: Adjusted to introduction of GFields. 

	* scattering/box_pnd_mono_size_1d.m: As above. 

2008-07-24  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-11

	* xml/xmlWriteGFieldWrapper.m (xmlWriteGFieldWrapper): Fixed "feature"
	of crash for empty grids, together with Oliver.

2008-07-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>
	
	* atmlab-0-3-10

	* Quick commit (before the bus leaves) of writing routines for GFields. 
	No time for testing, but should work.

	* xml/xmlWriteGFieldWrapper:

	Added wrapper function for writing GFields.
	Called by the xmlReadGriddedFieldX function to write GFields of
	arbitray dimensions.

	* xml/xmlWriteGriddedField[34]:

	Adapt it for the new GFields.

	* xml/xmlReadGriddedField[12]:

	Added.

	* xml/xmlReadGFieldWrapper.m: Small doc fixes.

	* xml/xmlWriteVector.m, xml/xmlWriteArrayOf.m

	Add the option to pass an attrlist to the writing function.

2008-07-02  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@core-dump.info>

	* atmlab-0-3-9

	* This version break code compatibility for GriddedField3 and
	GriddedField4!!!!

	The structure elements for the grids are no longer named p_grid,
	lat_grid, and lon_grid, but are now a cell array. A GriddedField3 for
	example has changed in the following way:

	gfield.p_grid   => gfield.grids{1}
	gfield.lat_grid => gfield.grids{2}
	gfield.lon_grid => gfield.grids{3}

	Additionally an array with the names of the grids (gfield.gridnames)
	has been added.

	* xml/xmlReadTag.m: Return attribute list to calling function.

	* xml/xmlReadGFieldWrapper:

	Added wrapper function for reading GFields.
	Called by the xmlReadGriddedFieldX function to read GFields of
	arbitray dimensions.

	* xml/xmlReadGriddedField[34]:

	Adapt it for the new GFields.

	* xml/xmlReadGriddedField[12]:

	Added.

	* atmlab-0-3-8

	* xml/xmlReadArrayOfLineRecord.m:

	Added routine to read ARTS XML catalogue files. Partly fixes
	ticket #6.

2008-05-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-7

	* MC calculations appear to work again (without f_index fix).
	
	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Removed temporary fix for MC concerning
	f_index. Possible after change in arts.

2008-05-29  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-3-6

	* Larger revision of qarts, beside for sensor and jacobian parts.
	The demos listed below run and results look OK. MC calculations
	for more than frequency do not work, due to an incorrect treatment
	of f_index in RteCalcMC (or rather poor treatment of f_index
	generally inside arts).
	
	* demos/qarts_scattering_demo.m: Updated. 
	* demos/qarts_demo.m: Updated, beside sensor part. 
	* demos/qarts_demo2.m: Updated, beside sensor part. 

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Changes in absorption, cloud box, scattering
	method and basic parts to match recent changes in arts.

	* arts/qarts_abstable.m: Improved header and check of Q. 

	* time/mjd2localtime.m: Added to atmlab. 

	* geoplots/shift_longitudes.m: Added to atmlab.

2008-05-27  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	Absrpt parts, and modifications following changes below.

	* handy/rqre_bool.m: The method now handles cases when the input
	is a cell.

	* arts/qarts.m: Changed NaN to {} for non-defined field.  This to 
	allow e.g. Q.ABS_SPECIES{1}{1} = 'ClO';
	This causes an error if the field is set to NaN. [] is saved for
	defined, but empty, input.

	Removed ABS_LINES_FMIN and ABS_LINES_FMAX. Sorting of line files is
	supposed to be handled in some other way.

	* atmlab/atmlab_defs.m As below.

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Introduced ARTS_INCLUDES

2008-05-09  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	fixed a typo.
	
	
2008-02-14  Bengt Rydberg  <benryd@chalmers.se> 

	* atmlab-0-2-226

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: modified.
	If a field in Q is nan, there is no error
	message and nothing is done, it is assumed
	that the necessary input are defined in
	the defaults field. 

	* arts/qarts.m: modified.
	Default values are nan.

	* atovs: Added. Will move atovs functions here.

	* atovs/old_routines: Added. For unadapted Bremen routines. The
	idea is to move adapted routines one directory up, or create new
	replacement routines there. Should be removed at some point in the
	future.

	* sensors/atovs_read_data.m: Removed big endian option from data
	read. 

	* sensors/atovs_read_header.m: Removed big endian option from data
	read. 

	* sensors/atovs_select_datafile.m: Fixed function name.

2007-12-10  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler(at)ltu.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-220

	* sensors/atovs_*: Added these functions again. We need them to
	read AMSU data. They were removed by Patrick in atmlab version
	atmlab-0-2-153 for being specific to Bremen. Patrick, please
	explain which parts are too specific, I'll try to fix them.

	* sensors/gmt_map.sh: Also added this again for now.

	* sensor/cloudsat_read.m: Function now gives a warning  
	when no unit conversion is implemented for the particular 
	datafield.
	
2007-10-30  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-201

	* demos/qarts_scattering_demo.m: METHOD_PRMTRS.SCAT_ZA_INTERP
	now set to 'polynomial' as this was found to be better choice
	for limb sounding cases.

	* arts/arts_tgs2species.m: Variable return_char was not set for 
	non-string input.

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Removed if-statement around REINIT.

2007-10-29  Mattias Ekstrom  <mattias.ekstrom@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-200

	* sensor/cloudsat_read.m: Now the scaling factor and offset in the
	HDF files is included in the reading routine. This is a general
	method that takes information from the HDF file itself, so this
	works for all datatypes.
	The conversion to SI units is still needed to be implemented for 
	each datatype.

2007-10-29  Mattias Ekstrom  <mattias.ekstrom@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-199

	* sensor/cloudsat_read.m: Function now gives a warning instead of 
	an error when no unit conversion is implemented for the particular 
	datatype. 

2007-10-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-198

	* Scattering batch calculations appear OK (in qarts and ASG).

	* arts/scenegen/asg2q.m: Work to handle particles in batch
	mode.

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Added sub-function add_rtecalc, to easily
	include call of relevant RteCalc function in batch part. Work
	on batch part.

	* arts/qartsBatch.m: Introduced field WSM.

2007-10-26  Patrick Eriksson  <patrick.eriksson@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Now includes setting of state for random
	generators.

	* files/create_tmpfolder.m:     Removed: rand('state',100*sum(clock))
	* randomize/make_noise.m:       from these functions. This approach
	* randomize/randmvar_normal.m:  is in fact quite dangerous when the 
	* randomize/randmvar_normal2.m: functions are called repeatedly inside
	                                a short time period. The same random
	number(s) are then generated. This was discovered as duplicates of
	randomly generated profiles were found. Of 10 1D profiles supposedly
	different, it was found that only 2 or 3 different profiles were 
	generated. This means that it is up to the user to init rand and
	randn for each matlab session if different random states shall be
	obtained. This can now be handled by atmlab option RAND_STATE.

	* arts/scenegen/asgG.m: Introduced the field SURFACE. 

	* arts/scenegen/asg_dimadd.m: Now working with surfaces in 1D cases.

	correctly.

	* arts/qarts.m: The option to define jacobian by a pre-calculated
	jacobian_quantities was removed. Was not implemented before. And
	not straightforward to implement as the jacobian-agenda is needed

	* atmlab-0-2-171

	* Large restructuring of qarts/qarts2cfile and surrounding
	functions. Maintenance and extensions should now be simpler.  These
	parts should work: setting up of absorption look-up table through
	ARTS-1.1 (done by qarts_abstable + arts_abstable), setting up
	sensor transfer matrix separately (arts_sensor) and calculation of
	spectra without scattering or jacobians). Spectra can now be calculated
	e.g. with on-the-fly absorption. Please test and comment.

	It appears that the matlab reading of xml sparse files does not work
	and sensor responses can not yet be loaded into Matlab.

	* arts/arts_absmodels.cfile: Created.

	Added functionality around absorption. Changed functionality
	(using DO fields) around sensor, jacobian and cloudbox.

	* arts/qarts.m: Polishing and update of text. Added fields around 
	ABSORPTION, and CLOUDBOX_DO, J_DO and SENSOR_DO.

	* arts/arts_y.m: Polished. And ydata added as output argument.

	returns NaN if these are not met. Introduced prior weight vector p
	as optional input parameter.

	* math/layermean.m: Added. Calculates layer mean values for a set
	of vectors. Handy for calculating IWP.

	* math/gauss.m: Added. The Gauss function.

2006-03-27  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-105

2006-03-16  Mattias Ekstrom <mattias.ekstrom@chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-102

	* arts/qarts.m: Added entry for pointing Jacobian.

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Added handling of pointing Jacobian.
	Changed the way fields are checked if they are empty. Now it
	should handle various combinations of cells, structures etc.

	* demos/qarts_jacobian_demo.m: Added water Jacobian.

	* arts1/alter_linedata.m: NEW. Simple function to alter the 
	spectroscopic parameters of lines in the linefile.

	* arts1/read_continua.m: NEW. Function to read a absmodel/continua
	file into a Matlab structure.

	* arts1/write_continua.m: NEW. Write a Matlab structure with 
	continua tags, as created by read_continua, to a file.

2006-03-15  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* physics/eps_ice_matzler06.m: 

	* atmlab-0-2-99

	* mie/epsice.m: Input arguments were given in wrong order in header.

	* mie/eps*.m: All dielectric functions in the mie folder should from
	now on not be used, beside for internally for Mie. This as these
        functions do not use SI units (and header information is poor).
	This is achieved by checking that calling function starts by 'mie'
	or 'eps'.

	* demos/qarts_doit_demo.m: BUG! Input to *epsice* were in wrong order.
	Now using *eps_ice_liebe93*.

	* files/create_tmpfolder.m: Made function safer. Now the random state 
	is scrambled (but reset before returning) and it is checked also by
	"mkdir" that the folder really not exist.
	(Bengt reported problems for 2-processor machines).

2005-12-17  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-89

	* Something had become wrong with tag numbers. Trying this 
	number instead.

2005-12-17  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-88

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Now using MC_SEED. *MCSetSeedFromTime* used

	* isinteger -> iswhole: Changed whereever needed.

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Included a function that copies functions
	in /obselete to /AUTO_fixes, if these functions not already exist.
	The folder /AUTO_fixes is created, or cleaned, before the copying.

	This fixes the problem with isscalar and isvector.
	
	This functionality can also be used if you want to use a function
	that only exists in newer Matlab versions, but otherwise would work
	with older Matlab versions. Then copy this function
	to the /obselete folder and everything will be fixed. However, make
	sure that te function really works with versions that can be expected
	to be used.

	* obselete/: Created this folder and moved isscalar and isvector
	to this folder.
	
	* .cvsignore: Created (to ignore /AUTO_fixes).

	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: The check 
	   if iscellstr( Q.SURFACE_PROP_AGENDA )
	used before isnan, which crashed.

	* atmlab-0-2-82 
	
	* arts/qarts_cloudbox.m: Removed DISTR_TYPE. No longer needed
	because from now on it is only allowed to read scattering data
	using the proper methods *ParticleTypeAdd* and *ParticleTypeAddAll*.	
	
	* arts/qarts2cfile.m: Removed DISTR_TYPE for DOIT and included
	possibility to use only IY_SURFACE_AGENDA and not
	SURFACE_PROP_AGENDA. This did not work for a blackbody ground. 
	
	* demos/qarts_doit_demo.m: Removed DISTR_TYPE and added EPSILON.

	calculation including the generation of scattering data using the 
	Mie code and the genearation of a very simple cloud layer. 

	* demos/data/doit_za_grid.xml: Added.

	* scattering/box_pnd_mono_size_1d.m: Creates a simple cloud layer
	including a monochromatic ice particle distribution. 

	* arts/qarts_cloudbox.m: Modifield DOIT angular grids. Now there
	are three separate variables N_ZA_GRID, N_AA_GRID,
	ZA_GRID_OPT_FILE. Modified use of DISTR_TYPE. 
	If you now like to read directly pnd_field as a Tensor4 and
	scat_field_raw this variable must be set to 'precalc'. Note that
	the data is in this case not checked inside ARTS.

	* Status: The generation of control files is now ready both for 
	ARTS and ARTS1 up to the point of generating spectra. So
	weighting functions from ARTS1 are now yet handled. 

	When setting up the same case for ARTS and ARTS1, basically identical
	spectra can be obtained (I managed to get inside 0.025 K without
	pushing variables controlling calculation accuracy to hard).
	
	Ask me if you want an example function.

	However, the function will be modified to be controled by a Qarts
	structure. Now the input follows the Qarts1 format.

	* arts1/arts1_get.m: Created this function.

	* arts1/arts1_absmodels.cfile: Added this file but it is not ready.

	* handy/qinfo.m: Included option of hard coding row brakes (by ?
	character), and possible to use trailing * for field names.	

	* arts/arts_write_linefile.m: Copied from AMI function write_linefile.

	* arts/arts_read_linefile.m: Copied from AMI function read_linefile.

2004-09-08  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-2

	* arts1/qarts1.m: Added a number of fields. 

	* arts1/arts1_cfile.m: Started on this function, generating ARTS-1.0
	control files.

	* arts/arts_abstable_from_arts1.m: Further work on this function. 

	* arts/arts_tgs_cnvrt.m: Fixed spelling error in error message.

	* handy/rqre_bool.m: Created this function.

	* handy/rqre_scalar.m: Created this function.

	* handy/rqre_char.m: Created this function.

	* arts1/addpath_ami.m: Created this function.

2004-09-08  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-1

	* arts/arts_abstable_from_arts1.m: A not totally ready function to
	generate absorption lookup tables. Needs templates stored so'far
	only locally.

	* arts/arts_tgs_cnvrt.m: Converts tag group information between
	Atmlab and ARTS formats.

	* handy/qinfo.m and qcheck.m: Created these two functions to
	faciliate handling of settings in the "Q way".

	* arts1/: Created this folder for functions related to ARTS-1.0.x.

	* arts1/qarts1.m: Started on this function, defining recognised
	fields for ARTS1 calculations (to be implemented). 

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Added path for arts1/. 

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Changed default values to be NaN, to make use of
	new option in prstnt_struct.

	* handy/prstnt_struct.m: Improved error messages and option 'require'. 

	* handy/out.m: Improved checks of VERBOSITY and SCREEN_WIDTH. 
	Included the possibility to write to files. Even files and screen
	in parallel.

	* files/create_tmpfolder.m: Improved check of WORK_AREA. 

	* files/delete_tmpfolder.m: Improved check of WORK_AREA. 
	
	* arts/arts.m: Better check of used Atmlab settings.

	* arts/arts_tgs_cnvrt.m: Added this function.

2004-09-07  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-2-0

	* Takes the step to version 0.2 as Atmlab now has a substantial
	content and I have changed the set of general settings. And the new
	set of settings shall hopefully be stable (settings can be added,
	but exsting shall not be removed or changed).

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Some settings removed and some added. Existing
	settings are now:
	   AMI_PATH    
	   ARTS_PATH   
	   ARTS1_PATH  
	   FMODEL_VERBOSITY
	   SCREEN_WIDTH
	   VERBOSITY   
	   WORK_AREA   
	Type 'help atmlab' for description of the settings. You need to modify
	*atmlab_conf*, if you have any.

	* arts/arts.m: Created this function to call ARTS from within Matlab.
	Note that you can do a call as
	   arts '-w all';

	* forward_model/call_fmodel.m: Removed this function as there will
	take a long time before it will be possible to switch between 
	different forward models in a general manner.

	* handy/out.m: Copied and modified this function from AMI.
	Use this function to produce screen output, if there is more than
	one or two lines of output. In that way you do not need to bother
	about checking VERBOSITY.

2004-09-03  Carlos Jimnenez  <carlos.jimenez@ed.ac.uk>
	
	* atmlab-0-1-86

	* handy/getfield_fromtip.m: adding a function as F =
	GETFIELD(S,'field') but using as 'field' the first field that
	contain the string tip. If no field containing tip is found, F is
	returned empty.

2004-09-02  Bengt Rydberg  <benryd@etek.chalmers.se>
	
	* atmlab-0-1-85

	* atmscenarios/ice_psd_Mcfar_97.m: Modified this function.

	* atmscenarios/ice_psd_Ivanova_01.m: Modified this function.

	* atmscenarios/ice_psd_Heyms_84.m: Modified this function.

        * atmscenarios/ice_psd_Donovan_03.m: Modified this function.

	* atmscenarios/ice_psd_Mitchell_99.m: added and created this function.

	* atmscenarios/ice_psd_ellipsoids.m: added and created this function.
	
	* Made a series of functions to generate cirrus ice particle size
	distributions. The functions are named as ice_psd_xxxx.m.

	* mie/Mie_xscan.m: Modified typo in this function.

        * mie/epsice.M: Removed this function.
	
	* mie/epsice.m: Added this function, changed from epsice.M
	to epsice.m. 
	
	
2004-08-10  Carlos Jimnenez  <carlos.jimenez@ed.ac.uk>
	
	* atmlab-0-1-84

	* maths/meannans.m: adding a function as mean but removing nans,
	not standard in normal matlab without statistic toolboxes.

2004-08-10  Bengt Rydberg  <benryd@etek.chalmers.se>
	
	* atmlab-0-1-83

	* atmscenarios/ice_psd_Mcfar_97.m: added and created this function.

	* atmscenarios/ice_psd_Heyms_84.m: added and created this function.

	* Made a series of functions to generate cirrus ice particle size
	distributions. The functions are named as ice_psd_xxxx.m
	
	* atmscenarios/ice_psd_Donovan_03.m: added an created this function.

2004-08-06  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-82

	* graphs/colorbarf.m: Replaced by new version from
	http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=1135. 

2004-07-20  Bengt Rydberg  <benryd@etek.chalmers.se>
        
	* atmlab-0-1-81 

	* Started on a set of functions to generate ice particle size
	distributions in atmscenarios/.
	
	* atmscenarios/ice_psd_heyms84.m: Created this function.

2004-06-30  Bengt Rydberg  <benryd@etek.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-80

	* Just a demonstration of CVS. 

2004-06-29  Mashrab Kuvatov  <kmashrab@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-79

	* Forgot to "cvs add" the files in the previous entry.
	
2004-06-29  Mashrab Kuvatov  <kmashrab@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-78

	* sensors/atovs_define_amsual1c.m: Added.
	
	* sensors/atovs_define_amsubl1c.m: Added.

	* sensors/atovs_define_hirsl1c.m: Added.

	* sensors/atovs_read_data.m: Added.

	* sensors/atovs_read_header.m: Added.
	
2004-06-10  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-77

	* arts/arts_ppath.m: Modified the function following changes in ARTS.

2004-05-24  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-76

	* physics/scattering_mplit2stokes.m: Created this function.

2004-05-12  Carmen Verdes  <cverdes@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-75

	* sensor/DataSelection.m: added (just a first draft!). It makes a
	selection of the data files, for specified satellite, instrument,
	year, month, day and  time (thought for AMSU data selection).

2004-04-30  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-74

	* physics/fresnel.m: Created this function to test ARTS
	implementation of surface reflections.

2004-04-13  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-73

	* sensors/amsu_limb2nadir.m: Changed the output to be the conversion 
	data (not the converted data). This to allow speed improvements, by
	applying the same conversion data on a batch of measurements in
	parallel. This solution also allows that the conversion can be inverted
	and it thus possible to go between differnt FOV. Not only to nadir.

2004-04-07  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-72

	* sensors/amsu_fov2za.m: Created this function, based on input from
	Viju.

	* sensors/amsu_limb2nadir.m: Created this function, based on input
	from Mashrab.

	* graphs/example_colorbar.m: Added another test option for zerowhite.

	* graphs/zerowhite.m: Fixed what Stefan started. Added a number of
	input checks. 
	There seems to be a bug somewhere in Matlab. Color levels can not be 
	set to go outside of data range on both sides. The function will
	not allow this. 

2004-04-07  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-71

	* graphs/colorbarf.m: Added. Correct colorbar to use with
	contourf. From the MathWorks site. IMPORTANT: The standard
	colorbar function does not work correctly with contourf!!

	* graphs/zerowhite.m: Tried to make the function work with
	prescribed contour intervals. This is important, since it is
	preferable to have "nice" contour intervals instead of fractional
	ones (in my opinion). Unfortunately this does not yet work
	correctly. I don't understand how the field w in Patricks code
	works, actually.

	* graphs/example_colorbar.m: Added. Demonstrates how zerowhite and
	colorbarf can be used to create a filled contour plot with correct
	colorbar.

2004-03-17  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-70

	* sensors/ssmi_read_1tbfile.m: Corrected data download information.

2004-03-16  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-69

	* sensors/ssmi_read_1tbfile.m: Created this function.

	* handy/set_defaults.m: Input arguments given as [] where not set to
	default values. Better cleaning up of _D EFAULT variables.

2004-03-08  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@linux.net>

	* atmlab-0-1-68

	* xml/xmlStore.m: Implemented eligible precision for floats in
	ascii output files as proposed my Mattias.
	Add optional fourth argument precision.
	precision could be either the number of digits which should be written
	on output, or a string containing either 'FLOAT' or 'DOUBLE'.
	FLOAT is equal to precision=7, DOUBLE is equal to precision=15

	NOTE: The default if precision='FLOAT'. I didn't want to take double
	as default because in most cases float is sufficient and with double
	precision the file size increases significantly because a lot of
	trailing zeros are written (and I didn't find a proper solution to
	turn them off :-( )

	* xml/xmlGetPrecisionFormatString.m: Added. Creates format string for
	the desired precision for use with printf.

	* xml/xmlWriteArrayOf.m, xml/xmlWriteArrayOfArrayOf.m,
	xml/xmlWriteColIndex.m, xml/xmlWriteGasAbsLookup.m,
	xml/xmlWriteGridPos.m, xml/xmlWriteGriddedField3.m,
	xml/xmlWriteIndex.m, xml/xmlWriteIndexVector.m, xml/xmlWriteMatrix.m,
	xml/xmlWriteNumeric.m, xml/xmlWritePpath.m, xml/xmlWriteRowIndex.m,
	xml/xmlWriteSparse.m, xml/xmlWriteSparseData.m,
	xml/xmlWriteSpeciesTag.m, xml/xmlWriteString.m, xml/xmlWriteTensor3.m,
	xml/xmlWriteTensor4.m, xml/xmlWriteTensor5.m, xml/xmlWriteTensor6.m,
	xml/xmlWriteTensor7.m, xml/xmlWriteVector.m:
	Add precision parameter. The parameter also has to be present for
	writing routines that are not outputting floats because all of them
	are called with the same arguments from xmlStore.

	* xml/xmlWriteHeader.m: Minor fix in docs.

2004-02-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@linux.net>

	* atmlab-0-1-67

	* xml/xmlReadGriddedField3.m, xml/xmlWriteGriddedField3.m: Added.

2004-02-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@linux.net>

	* atmlab-0-1-66

	* atmlab.spec: Added to ease building of rpm package for smiles
	cluster.

2004-02-13  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-65
	
	* files/delete_tmpfolder.m: Fixed bug in call of workarea.
	
2004-01-08  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-64

	* graphs/zerowhite.m: Yet another fix to handle strange logic of
	Matlab plotting. I hate the plotting in Matlab.

	It seems that the color map is looped in different order, depending if
	the minimum or maximum value (in absolute terms) is the largest. 
	Let us see if this works for all cases.

2004-01-06  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-63

	* handy/set_defaults.m: Created this script as a help to set default
	input for function arguments.

	Check it out, it is very useful!

2003-12-24  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-62

	* graphs/zerowhite.m: Bug fixed. The white level was shifted one
	step from zero.

	I was fooled by the Matlab colorbar. The numbers are not placed very 
	good. The "center" numbr for each color, is actually placed at the 
	upper end. I have no simple fix for this.

2003-12-16  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-61

	* graphs/zerowhite.m: Created this function to make color maps where
	the zero level is white. The result is not yet perfect.

2003-11-20  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-60

	* forwardmodel/call_fmodel.m: The old atmlab_get was called instead
	of new atmlab. Bug reported by Claudia.

	In addition, the function existed in two versions. There was also
	one version in files/, which is now removed.

	* files/create_tmpfolder.m: Fixed an incorrect call of atmlabm. Bug
	reported by Claudia.

2003-11-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-59
	
	* xml/xmlReadSingleScatteringData: Added.

2003-10-27  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-58
	
	* arts/optimize_za_grid.m: Added. For scattering calculations in ARTS 
	it is very important to represent the intensity field correctly.
	Either you take a very fine grid (then the calculation takes very long)
	or you optimize the grid using for example this function, which is 
 	the much better solution.

2003-10-26  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-57

	* physics/constants.m: Addded EARTHORBIT_RADIUS and SUN_EARTH.

	* atmlab/atmlab_version.m: Don't forget to update version here.

2003-10-26  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-56

	* physics/planck.m: Matrixified (referring not to the movie) the
	function. Frequency and temperature can now be matrices. If both
	are matrices, they must have the same size. 

	Try to implement this feature for every function.

	* physics/planck_wlength.m: Created this complementary function,
	taking wavelength as input instead of frequency.

2003-10-24  Mattias Ekstr?m  <ekstrom@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-55

	* xml/xmlWriteTensor7.m: Changed input argument 'filename' to 'fid'.

2003-10-10  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-54
	
	* physics/planck.m: Added the Planck function.

2003-10-08  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-53

	* sensors/amsu_channels.m: Created this folder and this function.
	The function returns basic information on AMSU specifications.
	Please add more data if you find it necessary.

2003-07-08  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-52

	* atmlab/atmlab.m: Moved this function from being a personal function
	to an Atmlab function. This function makes atmlab_get and atmlab_defs
	obselete. 

	The personal settings are now set by calls of *atmlab*. 
	See instructions in CONFIGURE.
	
	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Added to mie folder to the search path.
	Added call of *atmlab* and *atmlab_conf* to implement new way of
	to set personal settings.

	* These functions are removed due to changes above:
	    atmlab/atmlab_get.m
 	    atmlab/atmlab_defs.m
	    example/atmlab

	* arts/artsplanck.m: Removed as other functions in the folder shows
	how to use an internal template.

	* file/call_fmodel.m: Is moved to forwardmodel/call_fmodel.m.
	
	* */Contents.m: Removed all these files. I don't think they are 
	useful and hard to keep updated. The name of the subfolders should
	be clear enough to describe the content.
	
	* CONFIGURE: Updated text to new way to set personal settings.

	* INSTRUCTIONS: Removed some old information.

	* forwardmodel/i2planckTb.m: Wrote first header line description.

	* forwardmodel/i2rayjeanTb.m: Wrote first header line description.

	* arts/arts_plot_atmgrids.m: Added some text to the header.

	* arts/arts_ppath.m: Added some text to the header.

	* Small fixes in function headers for a number of functions not
	listed above.

2003-06-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-51

	* xml/xmlReadColIndex.m, xml/xmlReadIndexVector.m,
	xml/xmlReadRowIndex.m, xml/xmlReadSparseData.m,
	xml/xmlWriteColIndex.m, xml/xmlWriteIndexVector.m,
	xml/xmlWriteRowIndex.m, xml/xmlWriteSparseData.m:
	Added. Needed for reading sparse matrix.

	* xml/xmlReadSparse.m, xml/xmlWriteSparse.m: Make use of the
	reading/writing routines mentioned above.

2003-06-16  Mattias Ekstr?m  <ekstrom@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-50

	* xml/xmlReadSparse.m: Added function for reading Sparse xml files.

	* xml/xmlWriteSparse.m: Added function for writing Sparse xml files.

2003-05-21  Christian Melsheimer  <melsheimer@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-49

	* atmlab/atmlab_version.m: adjusted nr3 to 49

	* forwardmodel/mpm_iwc93_lwc93_rain89.m: 
	Corrected minor error in parameterization of complex 
	permittivity for ice water:  must read:
	b   = ( (0.233/(1-0.993/theta))^2 + 6.33/theta - 1.31 ) * 1e-5;
	            ^ 
	      not 0.223 
        
	Corrected error in parameterizatio of complex permittivity for
	liquid water (Double-Debye model):
	The parameters a and b actually have different denominators, 
	tmp1 = v_ghz*v_ghz + g1*g1
	and 
	tmp2 = v_ghz*v_ghz + g2*g2,
	respectively; not just tmp1 for both a and b (this error might 
	have propagated from the WATS report) - note that g2=39.8*g1. 
	To make sure, I checked
	with the papers Liebe, Hufford, Cotton [1993] (i.e., MPM93),
	Liebe, Hufford, Manabe [1991] ("A model for the complex
        permittivity of water at frequencies below 1 THz"), and Liebe's
	original MPM93 fortran code.
	
        	
2003-04-22  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-48

	* CONFIGURE: Updated location of atmlab_init script. (It seems to
	be now in subdirectory atmlab.)

2003-04-14  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-47

	* forwardmodel/mpm_iwc93_lwc93_rain89.m: Included parameter values from
	Christian for rain rates > 25 mm.

2003-04-11  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-46

	* atmscenarios/simplecloud_init.m: Some more default values introduced.
	Several cloud types defined. The cloud types follows roughly FASCODE.
	Cases with rain follow suggestions from Christian.

	Thomas and Christian: Please look and comment. The simplest way to
	check the definitions is to do:
	  C = simplecloud_init;simplecloud_plot(C);
	and select 1D, the cloud type of interest and just accept all default 
	values.

	* atmscenarios/simplecloud_plot.m: Fixed wrong xlabel for LWC. 
	
2003-04-10  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-45

	* graphs/ypatch.m: Created this function. Main purpose is to plot 
	retrieved vertical profiles with the confidence interval (e.g. +-1si)
	as a shaded area. See the header for an example.

	* graphs/xpatch.m: As complementary function to YPATCH.

2003-04-10  Thomas Kuhn  <tkuhn@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-44

	* atmscenarios/simplecloud_plot.m: update. Included an if
	statement if an ice/water/rain filed is defined in the cloud
	structure or not. If YES then plot the field if NOT then leave it.
	
2003-04-09  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-43

	* forwardmodel/mpm_iwc93_lwc93_rain89.m: Finished this function. 

2003-04-09  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-42

	* forwardmodel/mpm_iwc93_lwc93_rain89.m: Worked a bit on this function.
	IWC and LWC seem to be ready. Rain not done.

2003-04-09  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-41

	* atmscenarios/simplecloud_field.m: Created this function.

	* atmscenarios/simplecloud_plot.m: Created this function.

	* atmscenarios/simplecloud_XXXX.m: Finished a first version of this 
	set of functions. More cloud types have to be defined in the init 
	function. Thomas has promised to help me with this. 

	To test this tool, try:
	   help simplecloud_init
	   C = simplecloud_init;
	   simplecloud_plot(C);

2003-04-08  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-40

	* atmscenarios/simplecloud_init.m: Created this function. This is
	the attempt to solve one of the tasks for the ACE+ study. But this
	set of two functions can also be used for other studies. Some details
	to be fixed.

	* atmscenarios/simplecloud_get.m: Created this function. Purpose and
	status as above.
	
	* forwardmodel: Added this folder. To hold Matlab version of things 
	normally found in forward models. ARTS specific stuff shall be placed
	in arts/.
	
	* forwardmodel/mpm_iwc93_lwc93_rain89.m: Started on this function.
	Not ready!

	* physics/Int2Planck.m: Moved and renamed to forwardmodel/i2planckTb.m
	The move because the new forwardmodel folder fits better. The
	renaming to avoid starting with a capital letter, and to avoid Int
	which leads the mind to Integer (at least for me). (Claudia, OK?)
	"Vectorized" the function. 

	* physics/Int2RayJean.m: Moved and renamed to 
	forwardmodel/i2rayjeanTb.m. Reasons as above.
	"Vectorized" the function. 

	A note: The functions shall as far as possible work in a Matlab
	"way". That is, the input can either be a scalar, vector or a matrix.
	This is fixed normally by replacing * with .* and / with ./.
	
	* XXXX/Contents.m: Revised existing files and added Contents.m where
	it was missing.

	* atmlab/atmlab_init.m: Added new folders.

	vapor pressure over a plane surface of ice according to Sonntag,
	1994.

	* physics/Contents.m: Added information about the new functions.

2003-03-06  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-35

	* physics/wgs84.m: Copied and adapted this function from AMI.

	* arts/arts_plot_atmgrids.m: Made z_ground an optional argument, to
	supress plotting of the geoid and the ground. The function can now
	be used to plot an individual grid cell.

	* arts/arts_ppath.m: Fixed bug when z_ground is not a scalar.

2003-03-05  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* arts/arts_plot_atmgrids.m: Changed cb_lims to be a cell array, as
	for arts_ppath.m.

	* arts/arts_ppath.m: Added r_geoid as mandatory input argument. 

2003-03-04  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-33

	* atmplots/atmplot_pol2cart.m: As above.

	* arts/arts_sph2cart.m: Removed this function.
	
2003-03-03  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-31

	* arts/arts_ppath.m: Finished the function. It now works also with
	refraction.

2003-03-03  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-30
	
	* arts/arts_ppath.m: Started on this function. Instead of having
	many functions for doing 2D or 3D grid cells etc., the idea is now
	to calculate a full path when a figure shall be produced. This is
	the getaway function to get a path out of arts.

	* xml/xmlWriteMatrix/TensorX.m: Removed output form statement s(1)=1;

	* arts/artsplanck.m (iplanck): Added output format to cfile template.

	* arts/atmplot: Removed functions atmplot_gridcell2D.m and
	atmplot_gridcell3D.m.

	   gridcell_crossing_3d.m
	   poslos2cart.m

2003-02-28  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-28

	* files/qtool.m: Included an if-statement to avoid a warning for
	some Matlab version(s), when making "empty == scalar".

2003-02-27  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-27

	* xml/xmlReadGasAbsLookup.m: Read .xsec instead of .abs.

	* xml/xmlWriteGasAbsLookup.m: Write .xsec instead of .abs.

2003-02-11  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-26

	* xml/xmlLoad.m, xml/xmlRead*.m: Added support for reading binary xml
	files. Speed up in comparison to ascii is similar to the improvements
	in arts. Tried with 90 MB ampmat. Seems to work, but needs further
	testing. Claudia?

2003-02-10  Carlos Jimenez  <jimenez@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-25

	* math/nearestinvec.m: Adding a mscript to find the closest value
	in a vector to a given value.

	* NOTE: I notice the atmlab version was out of date, we should
	notforget to update the version number in atmlab/atmlab_version.
	
2003-01-20  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-24

	* AUTHORS: Added Christian Maetzler <christian.matzler@iap.unibe.ch>.

	* mie/: Added this directory, containing Mie scattering functions
	supplied by Christian Maetzler. Documentation is also there, in a
	pdf file. I added the files as they were, without making any changes.

	* mie/README: Added. Just contains a reference to the
	documentation. 

2003-01-09  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-23

	* xml/xml{Read,Write}{GridPos,Ppath,String}.m: Added.

	* xml/xmlReadTag.m: Fixed two bugs. Initialize attrlist. Setting
	exit_loop to 1 was missing in one else branch. (Why did it work
	before?!? :-o ) 

	* xml/xmlReadArray.m: Initialize result for the case that the array in
	the file is empty.

	* xml/xml{Read,Write}Index.m, xml/xmlWriteNumeric.m: Why do I always
	forget that strings in matlab must be enclosed in single quotes?

2002-12-30  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-22

	* arts/do_gridcell_3d.m: A Matlab version of the future ARTS function
	exists now as an internal function (with some short-cuts).

	* arts/gridcell_crossing_3d.m: More safe way to calculate r. Crossings
	with a length of 0 are now rejected.

2002-12-29  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-21

	* Basic functions to handle 3D path calculations seem to be ready.
	But a lot of work to do before everything is working.

	* arts/gridcell_crossing_3d.m: Created this function.

	* arts/obsplane2latlon.m: Removed this function.

	* arts/cart2poslos.m: Finished this function.

	* arts/poslos2cart.m: Fixed a bug.

2002-12-27  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-20

	* arts/cart2poslos.m: Started on this function.

	* arts/obsplane2latlon.m: Started on this function.

	* arts/arts_sph2cart.m: Created this function to test out an algorithm
	to be used in ARTS.

	* arts/poslos2cart.m: Created this function to test out an algorithm
	to be used in ARTS.

	* arts/do_gridcell_3d.m: Finished text for header.

	* atmplots/atmplot_sph2cart.m: Described the coordinate system used.

	* atmplots/atmplot_pol2cart.m: Described the coordinate system used.

	* atmplots/atmplot_gridcell3D.m: Improved the header slightly.

	* atmplots/atmplot_gridcell2D.m: Improved the header slightly.

2002-12-25  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-19

	* atmplots/atmplot_sph2cart.m: Created.

	* atmplots/atmplot_gridcell3D.m: Created.

	* arts/do_gridcell_3d.m: Created this function. Setting of 
	at_lower/upper_psurface to be fixed.

	* atmplots/atmplot_pol2cart.m: Changed the coordinate system so
	lat=0 equals now x=0.

	* arts/do_gridcell_2d.m: Finished this function.

2002-12-21  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-18

	* arts/do_gridcell_2d.m: The function works but documentation is
	lacking.
	The intention of this function is to test the ARTS function with the
	same name, and to be used for making figures in AUG.

	* atmplots/atmplot_pol2cart.m: The function works but documentation is
	lacking.

	* atmplots/atmplot_gridcell2D.m: Created.

	* physics/constants.m: Added constants EARTH_RADIUS, DEG2RAD and
	RAD2DEG.

2002-12-21  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-17

	* arts/artsplanck.m: Created this function to demonstrate the
	potential of qtool, and how to link a control file template with
	an actual ARTS calculation.

	* files/qtool.m: Copied the function from AMI and made some 
	modifications. The main change is that the template is given as
	a string array, which gives a higher flexibility. The template
	can now be read from a seperate file by file2strs, or be defined
	inside a local sub-function (as done for artsplanck).

	* examples/sample.tmplt: Added this file.

	* files/call_fmodel.m: Created this function.

	* atmlab/atmlab_defs.m: Changed FMODEL to FMODEL_NAME, and added
	the setting FMODEL_EXEC. 

	* files/file2strs.m: Created this function.

	* handy/tail.m: There is now an error message if the tail length 
	exceeds the length of the vector.

2002-12-20  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-16

	* CONFIGURE, files/create_tmpfolder.m, files/delete_tmpfolder.m,
	handy/min_nargin.m: Fixed typos.

	* atmlab/atmlab_get.m: Second argument name was 'requiered' but
	referenced inside the function as 'required'.

2002-12-20  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-15

	* files/delete_tmpfolder.m: Created this function.

	* files/create_tmpfolder.m: Created this function.

2002-12-20  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-14

	* handy/prstnt_struct.m: Particular code for version after 6.1 removed
	as the older solution still works, and the newer version caused
	an error in older Matlab versions.

	* atmlab/atmlab_get.m: Apparently exist('atmlab','file') also gives
	true for the atmlab folder and this caused a bug. The bug is fixex
	by looking for atmlab.m instead.

	* files/: Created this folder.
	
	* files/fileopen.m: Created this function. 

	* files/fileclose.m: Created this function.

2002-12-19  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-13

	* atmlab_version.m: Moved to atmlab/. Now you need to push more
	buttons to reach atmlab_version from ChangeLog, but I thought this
	was worth the advantage of having no Matlab functions in the top
	folder.

	* atmlab_init.m: Moved to atmlab/ and modified accordingly.

	* empty_heading.m: Moved to examples/.

	* example_heading.m: Moved to examples/.

	* atmlab_defs.m: Created a way to set personal settings. 
	Read CONFIGURE as an introduction. Please, check it out and comment. 

	* examples/atmlab.m: Created this function as a template for
	personal atmlab functions.

	* atmlab/atmlab_get.m: A gateway function to atmlab to make it
	possible to create decent error messages and allow that no personal
	settings are specified.

	* README: A simple README file. Some more text should be added later.

	* CONFIGURE: Info on how to start up Atmlab and create personal
	settings.

	* AUTHORS: Atmlab authors. Please add some text for you (Oliver: are
	you happy about what I wrote for you?)

	* examples/startup_menu.m: Merged some of my own files to create this
	file to give an example on selecting different environments at startup.

2002-12-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-12

	* xml/xmlWriteArrayOf.m, xml/xmlWriteArrayOfArrayOf.m,
	xml/xmlWriteVector.m: Allow empty objects.

	* atmlab-0-1-9

	* xml/xmlWriteArrayOf.m, xml/xmlWriteArrayOfArrayOf.m,
	xml/xmlWriteVector.m: Extended routines to deal with column and row
	Vectors/Arrays.

2002-12-19  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* xml/xmlWriteArrayOfArrayOf.m: Working commit with Oliver.

2002-12-19  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-8

	* xml/xmlWriteArrayOf.m, xml/xmlWriteArrayOfArrayOf: Added missing
	attribute type. ArrayOfArrayOf must call ArrayOf for each element.

2002-12-18  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-7

	* atmplots/atmplot_timeseries.m: Values were not centered before for
	facated and flat shading. Profiles are now plotted diferently, 
	depending on the shading. A NaN made two rectangles empty for flat
	and faceted shading (due to a strange behaviour of Matlab), which
	is now corrected.

2002-12-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-6

	* xml/xmlWriteGasAbsLookup.m: Corrected name of Array functions.

2002-12-18  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-5

	* xml/xmlWriteSpeciesTag.m: Added.

	* xml/xmlReadSpeciesTag.m: Make it work.

	* xml/xmlReadAttributes.m, xml/xmlReadTag.m: Parsing of tags with no
	attributes was completely broken.

2002-12-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-4

	* xml/Contents.m: Added documentation.

	* xml/xmlStore.m: Fixed copy'n'paste error.
	Added documentation.

2002-12-17  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-1-3

	* xml/xmlReadGasAbsLookup.m, xml/xmlReadSpeciesTag.m,
	xml/xmlWriteHeader.m, xml/xmlWriteMatrix.m, xml/xmlWriteTensor3.m,
	xml/xmlWriteTensor4.m, xml/xmlWriteTensor5.m, xml/xmlWriteTensor6.m,
	xml/xmlWriteTensor7.m, xml/xmlWriteVector.m:
	Adapted to be used by xmlStore.m.  

	* xml/xmlWriteArrayOf.m, xml/xmlWriteArrayOfArrayOf.m,
	xml/xmlWriteGasAbsLookup.m, xml/xmlWriteIndex.m,
	xml/xmlWriteNumeric.m: Added.

	* xml/xmlStore.m: General writing routine.

2002-12-17  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-2

	* atmlab_version.m: Just a demo commit.

2002-12-16  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-1

	* handy/tail.m: Created this function to get the last part of
	any vector.

	* graphs/axes_frame.m: The old version did not work for printing.
	That works now.

	* graphs/children.m: A comment regarding allchild included in the 
	header.

2002-12-15  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-1-0

	* Atmlab-0.1 !
	Introduced a first minor version to show that Atmlab is operational:
	Atmlab contains already a lot of useful functions and we are 
	using the package for Odin-SMR work. There are already about 60
	functions in Atmlab. If we add 60 functions per minor version,
	Atmlab will be a big toolbox when we reach Atmlab-1.0  :-)

	* handy/prstnt_struct.m: A help function to handle settings for
	environments and other purposes. 

	* graphs/tplot.m: Created this function to create easily plots with
	just text.

	* handy/nversion.m: A function to get the Matlab version number
	as a number. Can be used if different solutions are needed for
	different Matlab versions.

	* graphs/axes_frame.m: The axes are now restored fully when executing
	axes_frame(h,'on');

2002-12-14  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-0-15
	
	* graphs: The function find_legend is removed (I was confussed and
	thought that there is only one legend per figure, which is not the
	case. Functions for axes below, and legends are axes objects, 
	requieres now that some handle is given.)

	Several functions have been re-named:
	   legend_frame -> axes_frame
	   legend_text  -> set_text
	   legend_title -> axes_title
	   scale_legend -> scale_axes

	A handle argument is added to some of these functions.

2002-12-13  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-0-14

	* graphs/set_XXX.m: Created the functions set_axes.m, set_labels.m
	and set_titles.m. See on-line help for info.
	
2002-12-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-0-13

	* xmlAddAttribute.m, xmlOpenOutputFile.m, xmlWriteCloseTag.m,
	xmlWriteFooter.m, xmlWriteHeader.m, xmlWriteMatrix.m, xmlWriteTag.m,
	xmlWriteTensor3.m, xmlWriteTensor4.m, xmlWriteTensor5.m,
	xmlWriteTensor6.m, xmlWriteTensor7.m, xmlWriteVector.m:
	Implemented writing routines.

	* xmlGetAttrValue.m: Clear variables after use.
	
	* xmlReadTensor5.m: Fixed typo.

	* xmlReadIndex.m, xmlReadNumeric.m, xmlReadSpeciesTag.m,
	xmlReadTensor7.m: Added more reading routines.

2002-12-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-0-12

	* atmlab_init.m: Removed path artsfuns.

2002-12-13  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-0-11

	* physics/Contents.m: Added this file.

	* atmlab_init.m: Added the physics folder here.

	* physics/constants.m: Modified documentation. Now the help gives
	out a complete list of defined constants.

2002-12-13  Stefan Buehler  <sbuehler@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-0-10

	* atmlab_init.m: Added xml directory to path.

	* atmlab_version.m: Corrected function name.

2002-12-13  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-0-9

	* xml: Added reading routines.

2002-12-12  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-0-8

	* graphs: Created the functions:
	   children.m
	   find_legend.m
	   legend_frame.m
	   legend_text.m
	   legend_title.m
	   scale_fig.m
	   scale_legend.m
	   scale_text.m
	Type "help function" for more information. 

	The legend in Matlab does not always work veru well, but the legend
	functions above should be a good help to fix the legend when you
	are not happy with the default result. 

2002-12-12  Claudia Emde  <claudia@sat.physik.uni-bremen.de>

	* atmlab-0-0-7
	
	* physics: Created this directory. 
	This folder contains basic physical function needed for
	remote sensing applications.

	* physics/constants.m: Created this function, which returns
	physical constants or an error message, if the constant is not
	defined.

	* physics/Int2Planck.m: Created. Converts intensities to planck BT.

	* physics/Int2RayJean.m: Created. Converts intensities to 
	Rayleigh Jeans BT.

2002-12-12  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-0-6

	* math/isvector.m: Created this function. 

	* graphs/fit_to_paper.m: Wrote a header. Introduced vertical and
	horisontal borders and landscape paper size.

	* graphs/add_plot_row.m: Created this function. Check it out, it is
	cool.

2002-12-11  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-0-5

	* handy/min_nargin.m: Created this folder and this function. 

	* graphs/fit_to_paper.m: Created this function to set the figure size
	to match the paper size. Not ready!

	* atmplots/atmplot_timeseries.m: Renamed atmplot_scanseries.m to this 
	name. The function is now working. Maybe there will be some future
	modifications.

2002-12-10  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-0-4

	* example_heading.m: Changed the format on the starting line.
	The name of the function shall be there (in all uppercase letters).

	* math/Contents.m: Created this foler to hold:
	This folder contains functions performing basic mathematical 
	operations. Included are functions to determine the variable types.

	* math: Added functions iseven.m, isinteger.m, isodd.m, isscalar.m,
	vec2col.m and vec2row.m, where most are copiued from AMI.
	
	* atmplots/Contents.m: Created this foler to hold:
	This folder contains core functions to generate typical plots used to
    	display results retrieved from atmospheric remote sensing observations.

	* atmplots/atmplot_scanseries.m: Started on this function.

	* graphs/Contents.m: Created this foler to hold:
	This folder contains functions to make the usage of the different graph
 	commands in Matlab simpler. 
	See further the mentioned file.

	* arts/Contents.m: The folder artsfuns has been renamed to arts
	(as it is obvious that it contains functions).

	* atmlab_init.m: Added new folders. 
	Atmlab includes now functions also found in AMI. If you will use Qpack
	and AMI on the same time (maybe as part of Qpack), I recommend to run 
	atmlab_init before /ami/init to make sure that the AMI version of
	functions is used.

2002-12-10  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-0-3

	* This is just a commit to really add some folders and functions.
	More info in next commit.

2002-12-09  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-0-2

	* example_heading.m: Forgot to mention this file, and empty_heading,
	in the last commit. 
	I discovered that the AMI/Qpack type of headers in fact work rather
	poor with the Matlab help tool. So I have made new template functions.
	There are also some hints about optional variables. Please, read
	and comment.

2002-12-09  Patrick Eriksson  <Patrick.Eriksson@rss.chalmers.se>

	* atmlab-0-0-1

	* atmlab_init.m: This file adds the Atmlab folders to the search path.
	Call this function from your startup.m file if you want to use Atmlab.
	All folders that are added to Atmlab must be included in this function.

	* atmlab_version.m: The version number shall be transfered to this
	function before each commit. This function prints the version number.

	* INSTRUCTIONS: Instructions for future Atmlab authors. Please, read 
	and comment. 
	Oliver: I was not sure what to write about what you have to put in 
	Makefile.am. Can you add this?

	* artsfuns/Contents.m: Started on this folder, mainly as an example 
	(but so far a bad example).

2002-12-05  Oliver Lemke  <olemke@uni-bremen.de>
