* Compiling with g95 fails in certain configurations
  On Mac with gcc 4.8 (possibly other version too) from MacPorts, linking of
  arts will fail because of an undefined symbol ___ieee_divdc3.
  clang+g95 works fine.

  Solution: Use gfortran with gcc.

* gcc < 4.3 and OpenMP memory leak

The OpenMP implementation in gcc before version 4.3 fails to call
virtual destructors of variables declared as firstprivate. This leads
to a small memory leak in those configurations.

We recommend to use gcc 4.4 or later for ARTS.
