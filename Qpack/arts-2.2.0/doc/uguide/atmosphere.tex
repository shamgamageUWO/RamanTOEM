This section discusses the model atmosphere: how it is defined, its boundaries
and the variables describing the basic properties. One aspect that can cause
confusion is that several vertical coordinates must be used
(Sec.~\ref{sec:fm_defs:altitudes}). The main vertical coordinate is pressure
and atmospheric quantities are defined as a function of pressure
(Sec.~\ref{sec:fm_defs:grids}), but the effective vertical coordinate from a
geometrical perspective (such as the determination of propagation paths) is the
radius (Sec.~\ref{sec:fm_defs:atmdim}). Pressures and radii are linked by
specifying the geometrical altitudes (\builtindoc{z\_field}).


\section{Altitude coordinates}
%===================
\label{sec:fm_defs:altitudes}

\begin{description}
  
\item[Pressure\index{pressure}] The main altitude coordinate is
  pressure. This is most clearly manifested by the fact that the
  vertical atmospheric grid consists of equal-pressure levels.
  The vertical grid is accordingly denoted as the pressure grid and
  the corresponding workspace variable is \wsvindex{p\_grid}. The
  choice of having pressure as main altitude coordinate results in
  that atmospheric quantities are retrieved as a function of pressure.
  
\item[Pressure altitude\index{pressure altitude}] A basic assumption
  in ARTS is that atmospheric quantities (temperature, geometric
  altitude, species VMR etc.) vary linearly with the logarithm of the
  pressure. This corresponds roughly to assuming a linear variation
  with altitude. 

\item[Radius\index{radius}] Geometrical altitudes are
  needed to determine the propagation path through the atmosphere etc.
  The main geometrical altitude coordinate is the distance to the
  centre of the coordinate system used, the radius. This is a natural
  consequence of using a spherical or polar coordinate system. The
  radius is used inside ARTS for all geometrical calculations.
  
\item[Geometrical altitude\index{geometrical altitude}] The term geometrical
  altitude signifies here the difference in radius between a point and the
  reference ellipsoid (Sec.~\ref{sec:fm_defs:geoid}) along the vector to the
  centre of the coordinate system (Equation \ref{eq:fm_defs:zsurface}). This is
  consistent with the usage of geocentric latitudes (see below). Hence, the
  altitude is not measured along the local zenith direction.
\end{description}



\section{Atmospheric dimensionality}
%===================
\label{sec:fm_defs:atmdim}

The structure of the modelled atmosphere can be selected to have different
degree of complexity, the \textindex{atmospheric dimensionality}. There exist
three options, 1D, 2D and 3D, where 1D and 2D can be seen as special cases of
3D. The significance of these different atmospheric dimensionalities and the
geometrical coordinate systems used are described below in this section. The
atmospheric dimensionality is selected by setting the workspace variable
\wsvindex{atmosphere\_dim} to a value between 1 and 3. The atmospheric
dimensionality is most easily set by the functions \wsmindex{AtmosphereSet1D},
\wsmindex{AtmosphereSet2D} and \wsmindex{AtmosphereSet3D}.

    here spherically symmetric. This means that the radius of the
    ellipsoid, the surface and all the pressure levels are constant
    around the globe. The fields are specified by a value for each
    pressure level. The extension of the cloud box is either from
    the surface up to a pressure level, or between two pressure
    levels (which is the case shown in the figure). The figure indicates
    also that the surface must be above the lowermost pressure
    level. (``Geoid'' in the legend should be ``Ellipsoid''.)}

    pressure levels and the latitude grid points (that is, along the
    dotted lines). Inside the grid cells, the fields have a bi-linear
    variation. No cloud box is included in this figure.

\begin{description}
  
\item[\textindex{1D}\,\,\,] A 1D atmosphere can be described as being
  spherically symmetric. The term 1D is used here for simplicity and historical
  reasons, not because it is a true 1D case (a strictly 1D atmosphere would
  just extend along a line). A spherical symmetry means that atmospheric fields
  and the surface extend in all three dimensions, but they have no latitude and
  longitude variation. This means that, for example, atmospheric fields vary
  only as a function of altitude and the surface constitutes the surface of a
  sphere. The radial coordinate is accordingly sufficient when dealing with
  atmospheric quantities. The latitude and longitude of the sensor are normally
  of no concern, but when required the sensor is considered to be placed at
  latitude and longitude zero $([\Lat,\Lon]=[0,0])$. The sensor is assumed to
  by directed towards the North pole, corresponding to an azimuth angle of
  0\degree. A 1D atmosphere is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fm_defs:1d}.
  
\item[\textindex{2D}\,\,\,] In contrast to the 1D and 3D cases, a 2D atmosphere
  is only strictly defined inside a plane. More in detail, this case be seen as
  observations restricted to the plane where the longitude equals 0\degree\ or
  180\degree. A polar system\index{polar coordinate system}, consisting of a
  radial and an angular coordinate, is applied. The angular coordinate is
  denoted as latitude, and matches the 3D latitude in the range
  $[-90\degree,+90\degree]$, but for 2D there is no lower or upper limit for
  the latitude coordinate. The 2D case is most likely used for satellite
  measurements where the atmosphere is observed inside the orbit plane. The 2D
  ``latitude'' can then be taken as the angular distance along the satellite
  track. A 2D-latitude of e.g.\ 100\degree\ will then correspond to a
  3D-latitude of 80\degree. The atmosphere is normally treated to be undefined
  outside the considered plane, but some scattering calculations may treat the
  surrounding atmosphere in an simplified manner. A 2D atmosphere is shown in
  Figure~\ref{fig:fm_defs:2d}.

\item[\textindex{3D}\,\,\,] In this, the most general, case, the atmospheric
  fields vary in all three spatial coordinates, as in a true atmosphere
  (Figures~\ref{fig:fm_defs:3d}). A
  \textindex{spherical coordinate system} is used where the dimensions are
  radius (\Rds), latitude (\Lat) and longitude (\Lon), and a position is given
  as $(\Rds,\Lat,\Lon)$. With other words, the standard way to specify a
  geographical position is followed. The valid range for latitudes is
  $[-90\degree,+90\degree]$, where +90\degree corresponds to the North pole
  etc. Longitudes are counted from the Greenwich meridian with positive values
  towards the east. Longitudes can have values from -360\degree to +360\degree.
  When the difference between the last and first value of the longitude grid is
  $360\degree$ then the whole globe is considered to be covered. The user
  must ensure that the atmospheric fields for \Lon\ and $\Lon+360\degree$ are
  equal. If a point of propagation path is found to be outside the range of the
  longitude grid, this will results in an error if not the whole globe is
  covered. When possible, the longitude is shifted with 360\degree\ in the
  relevant direction.

    bi-linear variation inside the area limited by two latitude and
    longitude grid values, while the atmospheric fields have a
    tri-linear variation inside the grid cells. }

\section{Atmospheric grids and fields}
%===================
\label{sec:fm_defs:grids}

As mentioned above, the vertical grid of the atmosphere consists of a
set of layers with equal pressure, the pressure grid
(\wsvindex{p\_grid}).  This grid must of course always be specified.
The upper end of the pressure grid gives the practical upper limit of
the atmosphere as vacuum is assumed above. With other words, no
absorption and refraction take place above the uppermost pressure
level.

A \textindex{latitude} grid (\wsvindex{lat\_grid}) must be specified for 2D and
3D. For 2D, the latitudes shall be treated as the angular distance along the
orbit track, as described above in Section~\ref{sec:fm_defs:atmdim}. The
latitude angle is throughout calculated for the vector going from the centre of
the coordinate system to the point of concern. Hence, the latitudes here
correspond to the definition of the geocentric latitude, and not geodetic
latitudes (Sec.~\ref{sec:ppath:geoid}). This is in accordance to the
definition of geometric altitudes (Sec.~\ref{sec:fm_defs:altitudes}). For
3D, a \textindex{longitude} grid (\wsvindex{lon\_grid}) must also be specified.
Valid ranges for latitude and longitude values are given in
Section~\ref{sec:fm_defs:atmdim}. If the longitude and latitude grids are not
used for the selected atmospheric dimensionality, then the longitude grid (for
1D and 2D) and the latitude grid (for 1D) must be set to be empty.

The atmosphere is treated to be undefined outside the latitude and longitude
ranges covered by the grids, if not the whole globe is covered. This results in
that a propagation path is not allowed to cross a latitude or longitude end
face of the atmosphere, if such exists, it can only enter or leave the
atmosphere through the top of the atmosphere (the uppermost pressure level).
See further Section~\ref{sec:fm_defs:ppaths}. The volume covered by the grids
is denoted as the \textindex{model atmosphere}.

The basic atmospheric quantities are represented by their values at each
crossing of the involved grids (indicated by thick dots in Figure
\ref{fig:fm_defs:2d}), or for 1D at each pressure level (thick dots in Figure
\ref{fig:fm_defs:1d}). This representation is denoted as the
field\index{atmospheric field} of the quantity. The field must, at least, be
specified for the geometric altitude of the pressure levels
(\wsvindex{z\_field}), the temperature (\wsvindex{t\_field}) and considered
atmospheric species (\wsvindex{vmr\_field}). The content and units of
\builtindoc{vmr\_field} are discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:rteq:absspecies}.

All the fields are assumed to be piece-wise linear functions vertically (with
pressure altitude as the vertical coordinate), and along the latitude and
longitude edges of 2D and 3D grid boxes. For points inside 2D and 3D grid
boxes, multidimensional linear interpolation is applied (that is, bi-linear
interpolation for 2D etc.). Note especially that this is also valid for the
field of geometrical altitudes (\builtindoc{z\_field}). Fields are rank-3
tensors. For example, the temperature field is $T=T(\Prs,\Lat,\Lon)$. That
means each field is like a book, with one page for each pressure grid point,
one row for each latitude grid point, and one column for each longitude grid
point. In the 1D case there is just one row and one column on each page. The
representation of atmospheric fields, and other quantities, is discussed
further in Section~\ref{sec:wfuns:basis}, where the concept of basis
functions\index{basis function} is introduced. In short, the basis functions
give the mapping from the set of discrete values to the continuous
representation of the quantity.



\section{Geo-location of 1D and 2D}
%===================
\label{sec:fm_defs:geoloc}

For 1D and 2D atmospheres, \builtindoc{lat\_grid} and \builtindoc{lon\_grid} do
not contain true geographical positions (they are either empty or
\builtindoc{lat\_grid} contains transformed data). However, some operations
require that the positions is known, and this \index{geo-location} is handled
by \wsvindex{lat\_true} and \wsvindex{lon\_true}. See the built-in
documentation for further information on how to specify these variables.



\section{Hydrostatic equilibrium}
%===================
\label{sec:fm_defs:hse}

There is no general demand that the model atmosphere fulfils hydrostatic
equilibrium. That is, \builtindoc{t\_field} and \builtindoc{z\_field} can be
specified independently of each other. On the other hand, ARTS provides means
for ensuring that a model atmosphere matches hydrostatic equilibrium by the
method \wsmindex{z\_fieldFromHSE}. The method considers that gravitation varies
with latitude and altitude, and \builtindoc{lat\_true} and
\builtindoc{lon\_true} must be set for 1D and 2D.

Hydrostatic equilibrium gives only constrain for the distance between the
pressure levels, not for the absolute geometrical altitudes. For this reason, a
``reference point'' must be introduced. This is done by setting the pressure of
this point by \wsvindex{p\_hse} (common for all latitude and longitudes). The
geometrical altitudes matching \builtindoc{p\_hse} are taken from the original
values in \wsvindex{z\_field}. 


\section{The reference ellipsoid and the surface}
%===================
\label{sec:fm_defs:surf}

Geometrical altitudes are specified as the vertical distance to the reference
ellipsoid (\wsvindex{refellipsoid}), discussed further in
Section~\ref{sec:fm_defs:geoid}. The lower boundary of the atmosphere is
denoted as the surface. The surface is specified by its geometrical altitude on
the latitude and longitude grids. The workspace variable holding these data is
called \wsvindex{z\_surface}.

It is not allowed that there is an altitude gap between the surface and
the lowermost pressure level.  That is, the surface pressure must be
smaller than the pressure of the lowermost vertical grid level. On
the other hand, it is not necessary to match the surface and the first
pressure level, the pressure grid can extend below the surface level.


\section{The cloud box}
%===================
\label{sec:fm_defs:cloudbox}
In order to save computational time, calculations involving scattering are
limited to a special atmospheric domain. This atmospheric region is denoted as
the \textindex{cloud box}. The distribution of scattering matter inside the
cloud box is specified by \wsvindex{pnd\_field}, see further
Section~\ref{sec:rteq:absspecies}.

The cloud box is defined to be rectangular in the used coordinate
system, with limits exactly at points of the involved grids. This
means, for example, that the vertical limits of the cloud box are two
pressure levels. For 3D, the horizontal extension of the cloud box
is between two points of the latitude grid and likewise in the
longitude direction (Fig.~\ref{fig:fm_defs:3dcross}). The latitude
and longitude limits for the cloud box cannot be placed at the end
points of the corresponding grid as it must be possible to calculate
the incoming intensity field. The cloud box is activated by setting
the variable \wsvindex{cloudbox\_on} to 1.  The limits of the cloud
box are stored in \wsvindex{cloudbox\_limits}.  It is recommended to
use the method \wsmindex{cloudboxOff} when no scattering calculations
shall be performed. This method assigns dummy values to all workspace
variables not needed when scattering is neglected.

    Plotting symbols as in Figure \ref{fig:fm_defs:1d}. Radii and
    fields inside the cross section match the definitions for 2D.
    The vertical extension
    of the cloud box is defined identical for 1D and 3D. The horizontal 
    extension of the cloud box is between two latitude and longitude grid
    positions, where only one of the dimensions is visible in this figure.}

When the radiation entering the cloud box is calculated this is done
with the cloud box turned off. This to avoid to end up in the
situation that the radiation entering the cloud box depends on the
radiation coming out from the cloud box. {\bf It is the task of the
  user to define the cloud box in such way that the link between the
  outgoing and ingoing radiation fields of the cloud box can be
  neglected}. The main point to consider here is radiation reflected
by the surface. To be formally correct there should never be a gap
between the surface and the cloud box. This is the case as radiation
leaving the cloud box can then be reflected back into the cloud box by
the surface. If it is considered that the surface is a scattering object
it is clear that the surface should in general be part of the cloud
box. However, for many cases it can be accepted to have a gap between
the surface and the cloud box, with the gain that the cloud box can be
made smaller. Such a case is when the surface is treated to act as
blackbody, the surface is then not reflecting any radiation.
Reflections from the surface can also be neglected if the zenith
optical thickness of the atmosphere between the surface and cloud box
is sufficiently high.


\section{Wind and magnetic vector fields}
\label{sec:atm:vecfields}
%
The atmospheric fields discussed above are scalar quantities, while some
atmospheric variables can be seen as vector fields. However, in ARTS input
vector fields are broken down into the zonal, meridional and vertical
components and are given as three scalar fields. This division into scalar
values is used to allow that one or several of the components easily can be set
to zero, which is done be setting the corresponding workspace variable to be
empty. Following the standard naming scheme for winds, the components are
denoted as
\begin{description}
\item[u] The zonal component. A positive value signifies an Eastward direction.
\item[v] The meridional component. A positive value signifies a Northward
  direction.
\item[w] The vertical component. A positive value signifies an upward
  direction.
\end{description}
The workspace variables to describe the wind vector field are
\wsvindex{wind\_u\_field}, \wsvindex{wind\_v\_field} and
\wsvindex{wind\_w\_field}. To clarify the definition of the vector components
above, the winds components are defined as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item[\WindWE] A positive wind is defined as air moving
  from west to east, i.e.\ towards higher longitudes.
\item[\WindSN] A positive wind is defined as air
  moving from south to north, i.e.\ towards higher latitudes.
\item[\WindVe] A positive wind is defined as air
  moving upwards, i.e.\ towards higher altitudes.
\end{itemize}
As described above, one, two or all of these variables can be set to be empty,
if the corresponding wind component is zero. Winds affect the radiative
transfer by inducing Doppler shifts, see further Chapter~\ref{sec:winds}.


To consider Faraday rotation (Sec.~\ref{sec:faraday}) and Zeeman splitting
(\theory, Sec.~\ref{T-sec:at:zeeman}), also the \textindex{magnetic field} must
be specified. The three component fields are \wsvindex{mag\_u\_field},
\wsvindex{mag\_v\_field} and \wsvindex{mag\_w\_field}. All three components
must be specified (but can be set to zero for a part of, or the complete,
atmosphere). However, some component can be irrelevant for the calculations.
For example, the u-component has no influence on Faraday rotation for 1D and 2D
cases. (The internal representation of the magnetic field at a specific point
is handled by \wsvindex{rtp\_mag}. For this variable the three components are
stored together, and thus the local magnetic field is represented as a vector.)
