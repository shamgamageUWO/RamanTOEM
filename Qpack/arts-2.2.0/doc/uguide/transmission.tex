The term ``transmission calculations'' refers here to situations when the
emission from the atmosphere and surface can be neglected. These
calculations can be divided into two main types. The first one is when just the
transmission of the atmosphere is diagnosed (Sec.~\ref{sec:transmission}). The
observation geometry is then given exactly as for emission simulations, by a
position and a line-of-sight.

The second main type is radio link budgets (Sec.~\ref{sec:rlinks}). For this
case, the propagation path is determined solely by the position of the
transmitter and the receiver. That is, the user does not need to set a
line-of-sight of the sensor (receiver), it is determined by the transmitter
position. A characterisation of a radio link normally involves several
attenuation terms not encountered for passive measurements, such as free space
loss and defocusing. Faraday rotation (Sec.~\ref{sec:faraday}) is an additional
physical mechanism that is of special concern for active microwave devices (it
can normally be neglected at the higher frequencies used for passive
observations).




\section{Pure transmission calculations}
%===================
\label{sec:transmission}

This section discusses the \wsmindex{iyTransmissionStandard} workspace method,
that is relevant if you want to calculate the transmission through the
atmosphere for a given position and line-of-sight. The set-up is largely the
same as for simulations involving emission, such as that the observation
geometry is defined by \wsvindex{sensor\_pos} and \wsvindex{sensor\_los} (or
\wsvindex{rte\_pos} and \wsvindex{rte\_los} if \builtindoc{iyCalc} is used).
The first main difference is that \wsaindex{iy\_transmitter\_agenda} replaces
\wsaindex{iy\_space\_agenda} and \wsaindex{iy\_surface\_agenda}. The second
main difference is that handling of cloud scattering is built-in and the need
to define \wsaindex{iy\_cloudbox\_agenda} vanishes. These differences appear
inside \wsaindex{iy\_main\_agenda}. Further,
\builtindoc{blackbody\_radiation\_agenda} can be left undefined.

As for emission measurements (Sec.~\ref{sec:fm_defs:calcproc},
Algorithm~\ref{alg:fm_defs:iyCSagenda}) the first main operation is to
determine the propagation path through the atmosphere, but this is here done
without considering the cloud-box (it is simple deactivated during this step).
The possible ``radiative backgrounds'' are accordingly the surface or space,
i.e.\ where the propagation path starts. 

The next step is to call \builtindoc{iy\_transmitter\_agenda}. It should be
noted that the same agenda is called independently if the radiative background
is space or the surface. It is up to the user to decide if these two cases
shall be distinguished in some manner (no workspace method for this task exists
yet). For these calculations, the standard choice for
\builtindoc{iy\_transmitter\_agenda} is \wsmindex{MatrixUnitIntensity}. If this
workspace method is used, the output of \builtindoc{iyTransmissionStandard}
shows you the fraction of unpolarised radiation that is transmitted through the
atmosphere, and the polarisation state of the transmitted part.

The radiative transfer expression applied is
(cf.~Eq.~\ref{eq:fm_defs:vrte_step})
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:trans:vrte}
  \StoVec_{i+1} = e^{-\bar{\ExtMat}s} \StoVec_i 
\end{equation}
where the extinction matrix is determined in the same manner as for emission
cases (Sec.~\ref{sec:fm_defs:rad_bkgr}). In situations where the matrix
\ExtMat\ is diagonal, the scalar form shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:fm_defs:rte_step2}
is used.

The method determines automatically if any part of the propagation path is
inside the cloud-box (if active). If this is the case, particle extinction is
included in \ExtMat, following the same path step averaging as applied for
pure absorbing species. For this method, scattering is purely a loss mechanism,
there is no gain by scattering into the line-of-sight

A related concern is the treatment of the surface. In standard usage of the
method, there is no signal reflected by the surface, and the radiative transfer
calculations are started at the surface.

See the built-in documentation of \builtindoc{iyTransmissionStandard} for a
full list of possible auxiliary quantities. These data include quantities that
make it possible to determine the transmission for different parts of the
propagation path. For example, the state of \builtindoc{iy} at each point of
the propagation path can be extracted, and also the transmission matrix
(Eq.~\ref{eq:rte:transmat}) for each path step is accessible.





\section{Radio link calculations}
%===================
\label{sec:rlinks}

\subsection{Practical usage}
%
This type of calculations is handled by \wsmindex{iyRadioLink}. A sensor
position must be specified, as usual. The ``sensor'' takes the place as the
receiver of the radio link. The observation angles of the receiver are not user
input (if any given they are just ignored), they are determined by the position
of the transmitter. This position is given as \wsvindex{transmitter\_pos} or
\wsvindex{rte\_pos2}, dependent on if \builtindoc{yCalc} or \builtindoc{iyCalc}
is used. Specification of receiver and transmitter properties, beside their
positions, is discussed in Section~\ref{sec:rlinks:oview}. The quantities
returned by \builtindoc{iyRadioLink} are also described in
Section~\ref{sec:rlinks:oview}.

It is allowed to use \builtindoc{iyRadioLink} together with pure geometrical
propagation paths, but this option does not give realistic results as the this
set-up misses the impact of ``defocusing'' (Sec.~\ref{sec:rlink:defoc}). With
refraction, the propagation path can not be determined in a strict analytical
manner and some search algorithm is required, as discussed in
Section~\ref{sec:rlinks:ppath}.



\subsection{Determination of the radio link path}
%===================
\label{sec:rlinks:ppath}

ARTS contains so far just a quite simple algorithm for this purpose, activated
by applying \wsmindex{ppathFromRtePos2} in \wsaindex{ppath\_agenda}. The input
\builtindoc{rte\_los} is taken as the first guess for the observation angles of
the receiver. One way to set this initial value use
\wsmindex{rte\_losGeometricFromRtePosToRtePos2}, that sets \builtindoc{rte\_los}
to the angles for the geometrical path. For satellite-to-satellite links with
tangent points in the lower troposphere, the geometrical zenith angle can give
an intersection with the surface and it is recommended to use a lower start
value for the zenith angle. For 1D cases this is simply achieved:
\begin{code}
  rte_losGeometricFromRtePosToRtePos2
  VectorAddScalar(rte_los,rte_los,-2.5)
\end{code}
Another option is to use the angle from the last link, but this requires that
the links of an occultation is treated in a specified order, which is not
guaranteed when running with multi-threading.

New propagation path are calculated (from the receiver backwards towards the
transmitter) until a path is found that passes the transmitter sufficiently
close. The search and stop criterion is based on the smallest distance between
the transmitter and the path. However, this distance is evaluated as an
``angular miss''. The miss term is taken as the difference in zenith angle
between the geometrical path to transmitter and path point derived. If the
transmitter is placed inside the model atmosphere, the closest point is found
by an interpolation between the points defining the path. If the transmitter is
above the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA), the closest point is derived by
geometrically extend the path (from its end point at TOA).

For each iteration of the search, the zenith angle is updated. The first choice
is to determine the new zenith angle by a least squares fit, using data from
the three last ``test paths''. On the same time, the zenith angles giving the
smallest positive and negative angular miss are kept in memory, giving the end
points for new range of new zenith angles to consider. If the least squares fit
gives an angle outside this range, bi-section between the end points of the
search range is used for updating the angle. A special consideration to ground
intersections must be given (see the code for details). If it is determined
that the ground makes a link impossible, a dummy propagation path (of length 1)
having ``surface'' as radiative background is returned. The radiative
background is otherwise set to ``transmitter''.

The above is repeated until the miss term is smaller than the given accuracy
criterion, defined by the argument \texttt{za\_accuracy}. For a receiver in a
low Earth orbit, a tangent altitude accuracy of 1\,m corresponds roughly to 
2\topowerten{-5} for \texttt{za\_accuracy}.

If the selected criterion is not met, the calculations are re-started with a
smaller ray tracing step length (\builtindoc{ppath\_lraytrace}), and with last
value of \builtindoc{rte\_los} as ``first guess''. The decrease of the ray
tracing step length follows the argument \texttt{pplrt\_factor}. If the ray
tracing length is smaller than \texttt{pplrt\_lowest}, the calculations are
halted and a dummy propagation path (of length 1) flagged as ``undefined'' is
returned. The method returns \builtindoc{ppath\_lraytrace} set to the value
used for the final calculation.

A suitable start value for \wsvindex{ppath\_lraytrace} depends on the size of
refractive index. For satellite-to-satellite links close to the
Earth's surface a suitable value can be as low as 100\,m.


   
\subsection{Definition of attenuation and loss terms}
%===================
\label{sec:rlinks:oview}

The radiance law is not applicable for the signal from a point source.
The power received, $p_r$, by an antenna with an effective aperture size
$A_e$, located a distance $l$ from a transmitter, with power
$p_t$ and gain $g_t$, can be expressed as \citep[e.g.][]{ippolito:satco:08}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rlink:start}
  p_r(l) = t_a\frac{p_tg_t}{4\pi l^2}A_e,
\end{equation}
where $t_a$ is the transmission due to losses caused by the atmosphere. This
total atmospheric loss is the product between losses due to defocusing,
$t_d$ (Sec.~\ref{sec:rlink:defoc}) and gaseous and particle extinction, $t_e$
(Sec.~\ref{sec:rlink:atmext}):
\begin{equation}
  t_a = t_d t_e.
\end{equation}
The factor
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rlink:fspl}
  t_f = \frac{1}{4\pi l^2}
\end{equation}
represents the pure geometrical dilution of the power, following the inverse
square law. This effect is encountered also for propagation in free space, and,
accordingly, it is denoted as the free space loss. Please note that
other definitions of this quantity exists, see Section~\ref{sec:rlinks:free}.

With these definitions, Equation~\ref{eq:rlink:start} can be written as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rlink:pr}
  p_r(l) = t_d t_e t_f p_t',
\end{equation}
where $p_t'=p_tg_tA_e$, a term discussed further in
Section~\ref{sec:rlinks:free}.

The method \wsmindex{iyRadioLink} reports $p_r$ as \builtindoc{iy}, i.e.\ $p_r$
is treated as the main quantity. All loss terms ($t_d$, $t_e$ and $t_f$) can
be obtained as auxiliary data (\builtindoc{iy\_aux}). The auxiliary variables
include also extra path delay, bending angle and Faraday rotation. Some of
these terms can be obtained as attenuation/rotation/delay (per length) along the
propagation path.

Note the distinction between ``loss'' and ``attenuation''. The first term
refers here to path-integrated transmission factors, while the second term
refers to local attenuation coefficients. That is, losses are dimensionless
values, between 0 and 1, while the unit of attenuation is $1/m$. See the
following sections for details.

The quantity returned in \builtindoc{iy} is also what ends up in
\builtindoc{y}, outputted by \builtindoc{yCalc}. For increased flexibility, the
method \wsmindex{iyReplaceFromAux} allows the user to replace the content
of \builtindoc{iy} with some of the auxiliary variables. For example, for radio
link calculations bending angle can frequently be seen as the primary
observation, and this case can be handled by \builtindoc{iyReplaceFromAux}.
The constrain for allowing this swap of variables is that the auxiliary
variable to replace $p_r$ must have the same data dimensions. In practice, this
means that the auxiliary variable is a function of frequency, possibly being a
Stokes vector for each frequency. Variables fulfilling this constrain are:
defocusing loss ($t_d$), atmospheric extinction loss ($t_e$), free space loss
($t_f$), bending angle, extra path delay, and (total) Faraday rotation.


\subsection{Free space loss and sensor characteristics}
%===================
\label{sec:rlinks:free}

It is repeated that (total) free space loss is in ARTS defined as given
above in Equation~\ref{eq:rlink:fspl}:
\begin{displaymath}
  t_f = \frac{1}{4\pi l^2}.
\end{displaymath}
\underline{It is stressed} that this deviates from what
appears to be a more common (even standard?) definition of free space loss:
$\left(\Wvl/(4 \pi l)\right)^2$, where \Wvl\ is the wavelength of the
signal. This expression encompasses the relationship between the receiver's
effective antenna area and its gain ($A_e=g_r\Wvl^2/(4\pi)$). This later
definition was avoided to keep atmospheric and sensor effects clearly separated
in ARTS,

Hence, the definition of free space loss has consequences for how to specify
sensor characteristics. A possible choice is to treat pure multiplicative
factors such as $p_t$, $g_t$ and $A_e$ separately, and let ARTS handle the pure
radiative propagation effects. In this case, $p_t'$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:rlink:pr})
shall be set to unity (\wsmindex{MatrixUnitIntensity} handles this case). If
e.g. Faraday rotation or particle scattering is of concern,
\builtindoc{stokes\_dim} must be $>1$ and also the polarisation of the
transmitted signal is of concern, and must be included in the specification of
$p_t'$ (e.g.\ $p_t'=[1,\pm1,0,0]$ when V or H is transmitted). The next step
towards a more complete treatment of the transmitter should be to include $p_t$
and $g_t$ in $p_t'$. In any case, \builtindoc{iyRadioLink} expects
\wsaindex{iy\_transmitter\_agenda} to return $p_t'$, for each frequency in
\builtindoc{f\_grid}.

So far ARTS has no dedicated support to handle characteristics of receivers in
radio link configurations. The first step here should be to consider $A_e$, but
the simplest way to achieve this is to include $A_e$ in $p_t'$ (and it is here
where the definition of free space loss comes into play, as with the standard
definition $p_t'$ should instead include $g_r$). Some functionality developed
for passive sensors could also be of use for radio links, but this has not yet
been tested practically (even less validated) and these options are not
commented further.

Setting $\Mpi=p_r$ (to be consistent in the nomenclature used elsewhere) and
taking the derivative of \(\Mpi(s)\) gives
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fsplarts}
 \frac{\DiffD\Mpi(s)}{\DiffD s}=-\frac{2}{s}I(s).
\end{equation}
This equals the Beer-Lambert law with an attenuation coefficient of $2/s$. With
other words, the free space loss can be also treated as an ordinary extinction
term, and when ``free space attenuation'', $k_f$, is requested as an auxiliary
variable it is calculated as
\begin{equation}
 k_f=\frac{2}{s}.
\end{equation}
This extinction coefficient can be seen as non-linear, as it varies with the
distance from the transmitter. If the transmitter is placed inside the
atmosphere, $k_f$ becomes infinity for the path point corresponding to $l=0$.
The $k_f$-coefficient is not dependent on the definition differences of (total)
free space loss discussed above.


\subsection{Extra path delay}
%
In the absence of an atmosphere a signal sent from a transmitter in the
direction towards a receiver would follow a straight line, i.e. the shortest
geometric distance between the two instruments. Moreover, the signal would
propagate with the speed of light. The geometric distance, $l_g$, between the
transmitter and receiver is
\begin{equation}
l_g\equiv\int_{\mathrm{geometric}}1\DiffD s
\end{equation}
In the presence of an atmosphere, two changes follow,
the speed of the signal is retarded and the ray path gets 
bent. The optical path length is defined as
\begin{equation}
l_o\equiv\int_{\mathrm{ray}}\Rfr(s)\DiffD s.
\end{equation}
The geometrical length of the bent ray path is
\begin{equation}
l_r\equiv\int_{\mathrm{ray}}1\DiffD s.
\label{eq:rlink:lr}
\end{equation}
To recall what you probably heard during our physics lessons, some quotes from
the Wikipedia entry on optical path length: \emph{Fermat's principle states
  that the path light takes between two points is the path that has the minimum
  optical path length. An electromagnetic wave that travels a path of given
  optical path length arrives with the same phase shift as if it had travelled
  a path of that physical length in a vacuum.}

The total delay, compared if there would be vacuum between transmitter and
receiver, expressed in units of length, is
\begin{equation}
d \equiv l_o-l_g \ge 0,
\end{equation}
which can be expressed also as
\begin{equation} 
d = (l_o-l_r) + (l_r-l_g) = d_{n}+d_{g},
\end{equation}
where $d_{n}$ is the along-path delay due to decreased propagation velocity,
and $d_{g}$ is delay due to deviation from geometric propagation (refraction).

The (total) extra path delay, in units of seconds, is
\begin{equation} 
\Delta t = \frac{d}{c},
\end{equation}
and is provided by \builtindoc{iyRadioLink} as an auxiliary variable. 


\subsection{Bending angle}
%
The bending angle is a measure on the deviation from geometric propagation.
Using the nomenclature defined in Figure~\ref{fig:rlink:bangle}, the bending
angle, $\alpha$, can be calculated as \citep[e.g.][Eq.~6]{schreiner:99}
\begin{displaymath}
  \alpha = \phi_{\mathrm{GPS}} + \phi_{\mathrm{LEO}} + \theta - \pi.
\end{displaymath}
This equation is derived assuming what in ARTS is denoted as a 1D atmosphere.
ARTS operates with zenith angles and the equation above becomes
\begin{figure*}[!tb]
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics*[width=0.7\hsize]{bangle.png}\\
  \caption{Illustration of the bending angle of a satellite-to-satellite radio
    occultation \citep[copied from][Fig.~2]{schreiner:99}.}
 \end{center}
 \label{fig:rlink:bangle}
\end{figure*}
\begin{equation} 
  \alpha = \aZntAng{t} - \aZntAng{r} + \theta,
  \label{eq:rlink:bangle}
\end{equation}
where \aZntAng{t} and \aZntAng{r} is the zenith angle of propagation path, at
the transmitter and the receiver, respectively. This equation is applied for
all atmospheric dimensionalities, hence, any bending in the horizontal plane,
that can occur for 3D, is neglected.

A remark here is that the ARTS' zenith angles for the path are the ones to
observe the propagating radiation, and e.g.\
$\aZntAng{r}=\pi-\phi_{\mathrm{LEO}}$. Equation~\ref{T-eq:ppath:dlat} in
\theory shows that that without refraction $\theta=\aZntAng{t} - \aZntAng{r}$
(note the difference in notation), and Equation~\ref{eq:rlink:bangle} is
consistent with a zero bending angle for propagation in vacuum. Consequently,
ARTS should theoretically return a bending angle of zero if geometrical path
calculations are selected, but due to limited calculation precision a small
deviation from zero can be found.

%The bending along the path is expressed as
%\begin{equation} 
%  \frac{\DiffD \alpha}{\DiffD s} = \frac{\DiffD \ZntAng}{\DiffD s} - 
%                                   \frac{\DiffD \theta }{\DiffD s},
%  \label{eq:rlink:dbangleds}
%\end{equation}
%where $\DiffD\ZntAng/\DiffD s$ is the change in zenith angle along the path,
%and $\DiffD\theta/\DiffD s$ is the same for the angular distance to the
%transmitter, both calculated by local approximations of the change of the
%angles.



\subsection{Defocusing}
\label{sec:rlink:defoc}
%
A special effect for radio links is defocusing. This effect is caused by the
fact that refraction varies over the wavefront. In short, defocusing occurs if
neighbouring ray-paths diverge more quickly than for free space propagation.
This is the typical situation for limb sounding due to the vertical variation
of the refractive index, causing an additional divergence of the transmitted
power. The opposite, focusing, is also possible. In fact, already for an ideal
spherically symmetric atmosphere a focusing effect takes place in the
horizontal dimension, caused by the curvature of the planet. In this case, the
middle point of the beam experiences the highest refractive index and has then
the lowest propagation speed. This, in addition to symmetry around the middle
point, counteracts partly the free space divergence of the power.

Defocusing can be estimated by two different algorithms, simple denoted as
method 1 and 2. The user selects the method to apply by the argument
\texttt{defocus\_method}.

\subsubsection{Defocusing, method 1}
\label{sec:rlink:defocm1}

This method is intended to be general, using a very simple calculation
approach. The optical path length between the transmitter and the receiver is
determined, here denoted as $l_o$. This is followed by that two propagation
paths are calculated, with slight shifts in the zenith angle. The size of the
angular shift is an user input (\texttt{defocus\_shift}).

The spatial position where each of the two shifted paths have an optical path
length of $l_o$ is determined. The distance between these two points are
compared to what is expected for free space propagation. If, for example, the
distance is double as high compared to the free space case, this is taken as a
defocusing ``transmission'' of 0.5. The factor can be higher than 1, which
corresponds to conditions of focusing. Only the zenith angle dimension is
considered, any defocusing/focusing in the horizontal plane is neglected (which
in general should be a good approximation). 

The method can be applied for all possible links, e.g. links inside the
atmosphere, for ground-to-satellite links and satellite-to-satellite links. In
the last case, if the path with the highest zenith angle intersects with the
ground, the defocusing is calculated using the nominal path and the low zenith
angle path.


\subsubsection{Defocusing, method 2}
\label{sec:rlink:defocm2}

This method is restricted to satellite-to-satellite links. The defocusing
effect in this case, of a transmitted signal with intensity \(I_{0}\), can be
described as \citep{haugstad:78:turbu,kursinski:00:thegp}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:foc1}
I=I_{0}M_{\alpha}M_{\beta},
\end{equation}
where \(M_{\alpha}\) and \(M_{\beta}\) is the vertical and horizontal
defocusing factors, respectively. In general, the defocusing effect is fairly
complex in a modelling perspective, although for special cases the defocusing
factors can be calculated analytically. Such analytic expressions can be used
for "test cases" of more general solutions. For a signal transmitted in a limb
geometry through a spherical symmetric atmosphere (i.e.\ 1D), with an
exponential scale height \(H\), \citep{haugstad:78:turbu}
\begin{eqnarray}
 M_{\alpha} &=& \left[1+\frac{\alpha L_{r}}{H} \right]^{-1}, \nonumber \\
 M_{\beta}  &=& \left[1-\frac{\alpha L_{r}}{R} \right]^{-1}, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where \(\alpha\) is the bending angle (Eq.~\ref{eq:rlink:bangle}), \(L_{r}\) is
the distance from the tangent point to the receiver, and \(R\) is the planet
radius. An alternative form of the equations above, also
also valid for an atmosphere with a non-exponential scale height is
\citep{kursinski:00:thegp}
\begin{eqnarray}
 \label{eq:kur1}
 M_{\alpha} &=& \left[1+\frac{\DiffD \alpha}{\DiffD a} 
               \frac{{L_{t}L_{r}}}{L_{r}+L_{t}} \right]^{-1}, \\
\label{eq:kur2}
 M_{\beta} &=& \left[1-\frac{\alpha}{R}
              \frac{{L_{t}L_{r}}}{L_{r}+L_{t}} \right]^{-1},
\end{eqnarray}
where $L_{t}$ and $L_{r}$ is the distance between the tangent point and the
transmitter and receiver, respectively, and \(a\)=\(\Rfr\Rds\sin(\ZntAng)\) is
denoted as the impact parameter (and is equal to the ``propagation path
constant'' defined in Eq.~\ref{T-eq:ppath:snellspherical} of \theory).

The bending angle ($a$) is given by the derived path between the transmitter and
receiver. The term $\DiffD \alpha/\DiffD a$ is estimated using calculations
with shifted zenith angles, with a shift set by the user
(\texttt{defocus\_shift}). Hence, this term is calculated in a manner similar
to the approach used in method 1.


\subsection{Atmospheric extinction}
\label{sec:rlink:atmext}
%
Atmospheric absorption and scattering are handled exactly as for
\builtindoc{iyTransmissionStandard}. Accordingly, only scattering
out-of-the propagation path is considered.



% \subsection{Some additional defocusing theory}
% \label{sec:rlink:defoc2}
% %
% The derivations of, for example, \citet{haugstad:78:turbu} were made using the
% framework of geometrical optics. In this framework, the equation describing the
% propagation direction of a ray can be written as
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:eik}
% \Rfr\frac{\DiffD \bf{\Rds}}{\DiffD s}=\nabla S,
% \end{equation}
% where \(S\) (often called eikonal) is a function describing the wavefront
% (\(S(\bf{\Rds})\)=constant represents a wave front). According to
% \cite{born:80} the intensity ratio of any two points along a ray can be
% expressed as
% \begin{equation}
% \frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}}=\frac{\Rfr_{2}}{\Rfr_{1}}
% \exp \left(-\int_{s_{1}}^{s_{2}}\frac{\nabla^{2}S}{n}ds\right),
% \end{equation}
% where the integrand 
% or the along path contribution to the intensity variation is
% \begin{eqnarray}
% \label{eq:def4}
% \frac{\nabla^{2}S}{n} &=& \frac{\nabla \cdot \nabla S}{n}
% =\frac{\nabla \cdot \left(\Rfr\frac{\DiffD \bf{\Rds}}{\DiffD s}\right)}{\Rfr} \nonumber \\
% & = & 
% \frac{\nabla \Rfr}{\Rfr} \cdot \frac{\DiffD \bf{\Rds}}{\DiffD s}
% +\nabla \cdot \frac{\DiffD \bf{\Rds}}{\DiffD s}=
% \frac{1}{\Rfr}\frac{\DiffD \Rfr}{\DiffD s}+\nabla \cdot \frac{\DiffD \bf{\Rds}}{\DiffD s}. 
% \end{eqnarray}
% The first term on the right hand side of Equation~\ref{eq:def4}
% is related to the along path variation of refractive index and it is 
% an unproblematic term in a modelling perspective.
% The second term on the right hand side of Equation~\ref{eq:def4}
% is the divergence of the vector pointing in the direction 
% of the ray.  If the signal initially is travelling in the \(x\)-direction,
% we have for small bending angles \citep{haugstad:78:turbu}
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq:raydiv}
% \nabla \cdot \frac{\DiffD \bf{\Rds}}{\DiffD s}\approx
% \frac{\DiffD \alpha}{\DiffD z}+\frac{\DiffD \beta}{\DiffD y}
% \end{equation}
% where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) is the bending angle in the \(xz\)-plane and
% \(xy\)-plane, respectively (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) can in this case be seen
% as the \(z\) and \(y\) component of the propagation direction vector). The
% bending angle is an integrated measure of the refractive index in the
% atmosphere traversed by the ray. That is, at a given point along the
% propagation path, the bending angle depends on the history of the path. This
% has the consequence, that if we only perform calculations along the propagation
% path and do not consider the history of the path, it will be problematic to
% approximate the \(\alpha\) term in Equation \ref{eq:raydiv}. A solution to the
% problem for a spherically symmetric atmosphere (and for small bending angles)
% is given in \citet{haugstad:78:turbu}. No suitable solution of analytical
% character for the general case has been found, and instead a pure numerical
% approach was implemented (Section~\ref{sec:rlink:defoc2}).
