# Wind
# Note: If you want N-S or E-W wind, you have to use a 3D atmosphere. Use the
#  other, 3D atmosphere, template for that!
# NOTE: For Jupiter, no vertical wind data is available (only E-W wind).
#  Hence, no considering of wind in Jupiter 1D case (it won't have any effect
#  here) and you HAVE to use the 3D template, if you want wind.

#===========================================

# Magnetic Field
# NOTE: Using the components separately hardly makes sense, we therefore
#  automatically read in all 3 components of the field. Also note that it is
#  highly RECOMMENDED to do the calculations in 3D (use the respective
#  template!).
