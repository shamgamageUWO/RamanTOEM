# This is a template file for doing scattering calculations of passive         #
# measurements using the Fixed Order of Scattering solver. It is for a 1D      #
# atmosphere.                                                                  #
# The file is supposed to be used as an include file in a full radiative       #
# transfer case. Atmospheric scenario, surface and sensor settings, etc. have  #
# to be done in the calling file before this file is included (hence,          #
# executed).                                                                   #
