#  That is, RT calculations for n_LOS = n_viewang + n_tanh pencilbeam LOS
#  directions will be performed.
#  Azimuth angles (viewang_azi and tanh_azi) are equivalently appended, too, and

#  NOTE: uncomment the ONE(!) you want. If more than one uncommented, the run
#   will crash.
#  NOTE: Cases b-1 and c-1 only are correct if the refracting atmosphere (i.e.,
#   the atmospheric parameters that affect refraction in the model: z(p), T, N2,
#   O2, CO2, H2, H2, H2O) is horizontally homogeneous.
#  Note: Calculated zenith angles exactly correspond to the given tangent
#   altitudes only if the planet is spherical (i.e., refellipsoid[1]=e==0), else
#   local planet curvature, which is effected by latitude and azimuthal viewing
#   direction, might cause some deviations. However, we correct for that to a
#   wide extent, such that the output zenith angles are a very good
#   approximation.
#  No problems occur for the lines-of-sight that are specified via zenith
#   viewing angles. That is, in case of doubt EXCLUSIVELY USE zenith VIEWING
#   ANGLES!

#  Doppler shifts.)
INCLUDE "planetary_toolbox/includes/common/use-absOnTheFly.arts"

# b) calculate and use absorption lookup table
# Note: Either of the 2 includes below is ok to use. make-and-use-absLUT.arts is
#  the more general solution, also working for REAL 3D data (while, here we have
#  only homogeneous 3D created from 1D). make-and-use-absLUT_1Dfor3D.arts is
#  faster as it only calculates the LUT for a 1D case (assuming the given
#  atmosphere is homogeneous).
#INCLUDE "planetary_toolbox/includes/common/make-and-use-absLUT_1Dfor3D.arts"
#INCLUDE "planetary_toolbox/includes/common/make-and-use-absLUT.arts"
# b-1) if you want to keep the absLUT data for later use or analysis, uncomment:
#WriteXML( in=abs_lookup )
