# This INCLUDE file is for                                                     #
#  - NOT considering refraction                                                #
#  - 1D calculations only                                                      #
#  - several viewing angles (incl. tangent altitudes) from constant observer   #
#     position                                                                 #
#  - for use with iyCalc (not yCalc)                                           #
#  - for receiver-only setups (no receiver-transmitter paths!)                 #
#                                                                              #
# It performs the following actions:                                           #
#  - sets ppath_agenda: receiver-viewingangle determined path (no transmitter) #
#  - sets ppath_step_agenda: pure geometric ppath calculation (NO refraction)  #
#  - calculates viewing angles from given vector of tangent altitudes          #
#  - creates a common vector from (given) viewing angle vector and the viewing #
#     angles associated with the tangent altitudes                             #
#  - sets sensor positions: constant receiver position, empty transmitter      #
#                                                                              #
# It requires the following input:                                             #
#   viewzang        Vector; the viewing angles (1D, i.e. zenith only)          #
#   tanh            Vector; the tangent altitudes                              #
#   obsh            Numeric; the receiver altitude                             #
#   refellipsoid    as the WSV                                                 #
#   atmosphere_dim  as the WSV                                                 #
# It also uses (OVERWRITES!) sensor_pos.                                       #
#                                                                              #
# It provides following output:                                                #
#   allzang         Vector; merged (1D) viewing angles resulting from viewang  #
#                    and calculated viewing angles resulting from tanh         #
#                                                                              #
