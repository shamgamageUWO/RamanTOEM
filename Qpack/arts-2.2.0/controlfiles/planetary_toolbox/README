This folder holds ARTS controlfiles tailor-made for ESA Planetary Toolbox project.

They are supposed to 
    - provide ready-to-run controlfile for common/high-interest case(s)
    - act as templates for modified setups
   [- demonstrate usage of ARTS and some available options?]
   [- present the available toolbox data (atmo/surface/clouds...) & provide an
       easy way to select from it?]

Starting out with the 2-3 cases Nicolas Floury expressed particular interest in:

1/ sub-millimeter wave instrument for atmospheric science
       - applicable to any planet
       - passive instrument in orbit
       - nadir or limb sounding
       - pencil beam
       - center frequencies and spectral resolution TBD (a range of
frequencies that could be of interest for a given planet can be proposed for
the sole purpose of illustration, for example 540-660GHz for Mars atmosphere)
       - outputs: Tb as function of frequency for the spectral resolution
provided as input

2/ radio science through planetary atmosphere
       - applicable to any planet
       - one or two frequencies and associated bandwidths
       - transmitter in orbit, receiver on Earth (planetary science)
                MaRS on Mars Express: 2.4 and 8.3GHz (
http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31033&fbodylongid=660
)
                VeRA on Venus Express (idem)
       - transmitter in MEO, receiver in LEO (Earth science)
                GRAS on MetOP
       - outputs: total and atmospheric attenuation as function of time

3/ link budget computation
       - applicable to any planet
       - transmitter in orbit
       - one centre frequency and associated bandwidths
       - performance of a 35GHz based CW radar for altitude monitoring of a
landing probe during a dust storm (attenuation, ...)
       - outputs: SNR of the surface during a descent

-----
for first version, chose a (fix) planet/atmo setup/geometry/...
further decisions of options to include & how to organize (building block formation?
 complete separate controlfiles or out-commented options or replaceable includes...?)
 them will follow.
