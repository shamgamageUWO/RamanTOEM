# General ARTS defaults
#
# The basic philosophy here is, that general.arts shall always be included by an
# ARTS controlfile. general.arts contains such settings, which are (very often)
# necessary, but on the other hand the user rarely wants/needs to reset (or is
# discouraged to do so).
# The settings done below can be divided into 3 categories:
# 1) settings that serve (mainly) as initialisations
# 2) settings the user is highly discouraged to change
# 3) settings that define some meaningful, widely valid/applicable defaults

# abs_f_interp_order should normally be set to 0. However, if you are doing
# calculations with Doppler shift (e.g., wind, planet rotation, or satellite
# movement considered in forward calculation), you NEED to set it to >=l. This
# regardless of whether you use absorption lookup tables or on-the-fly
# calculation of absorption. In case of on-the-fly it will have no practical
# effects. In case of lookup tables, you should choose abs_f_interp_order
# depending on the frequency interpolation scheme you want.

# Variable for calculation of propagation paths:
