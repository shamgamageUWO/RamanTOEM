# ARTS setup file for simulations of Odin-SMR measurements around 501.8 GHz.
# This band is part of the stratospheric mode, denoted as SM_AC2ab.
#
# The simulations are intended to match the operational settings, but there
# are some differences. See notes below.
#
# This file assumes that each tangent altitude is treated as a measurement
# block. 
#
# Input files are found in the folder tests/OdinSMR.
# See setup_input.m for source of input files.
