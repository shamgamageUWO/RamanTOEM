# Compact line list, to kick out lines that are outside there 
# cutoff range for all frequencies.
#abs_lines_per_speciesCompact

# If there was a method to convert abs_lines_per_species back to
# abs_lines, then we could do that, and save that file. The only
# problem is, though, that the lines to include are not exactly the same
# for all the different versions of the HIRS sensor. Thus, one would
# also have to perform a merge of all the different resulting line
# lists. :-(
