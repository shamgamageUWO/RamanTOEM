Notes:

1. The antenna pattern (amsub.antenna.xml) is not used by the standard setup.

2. The matlab script (setup_input.m) can be used to produce the
antenna pattern. It can produce also other sensor description files,
but these are no longer necessary for the simplified sensor setup with
the ARTS method sensor_responseSimpleAMSU.
