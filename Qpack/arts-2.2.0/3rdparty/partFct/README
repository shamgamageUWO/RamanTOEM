This folder contains tools and data for the derivation of partition	function
 polynomial coefficients for ARTS:

TIPS/
Latest version of the TIPS program (slightly modified for all-species tabulated
 Q(T) output).

TIPS_70-3000K.DAT
TIPS tabulated partition functions over full TIPS temperature range on 1K-step
 grid. That is the data recent additions of coefficients are based on (for the
 older species, the data seems to have not changed. only made random checks,
 though.)

partition_functions.py
Python routines for deriving polynomial coefficients from TIPS or JPL partition
 function data. Largely incomplete for JPL species. Partly only taken over &
 converted to python from partition_function.pro (specifically the vibrational
 correction).

partition_functions.pro
Copied from ARTS-1.0 branch (misc/part_fct/). IDL code to derive HITRAN/TIPS and
 JPL based partition fucntions and polynomial coefficients. Also includes
 routines for comparison & plotting of the data from the different sources.
