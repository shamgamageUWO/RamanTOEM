T-Matrix codes
======================

The code can be used without limitations in any not-for-
profit scientific research.  We only request that in any
publication using the code the source of the code be acknowledged
and relevant references (see below) be made.

This version of the code is applicable to spheroids,
Chebyshev particles, and finite circular cylinders.

The computational method is based on the Watermsn's T-matrix
approach and is described in detail in the following papers:

1.  M. I. Mishchenko, Light scattering by randomly oriented
    axially symmetric particles, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A,
    vol. 8, 871-882 (1991).

    distributions of randomly oriented axially symmetric
    particles of a size comparable to a wavelength,
    Appl. Opt., vol. 32, 4652-4666 (1993).

    of light scattering by large spheroidal particles,
    Opt. Commun., vol. 109, 16-21 (1994).

    of light by polydisperse, randomly oriented, finite
    circular cylinders, Appl. Opt., vol. 35, 4927-4940 (1996).

    weakly absorbing nonspherical particles and comparison

A general review of the T-matrix approach can be found in

    particles: a review, J. Quant. Spectrosc. Radiat.

The following paper provides a detailed user guide to the
T-matrix code:
