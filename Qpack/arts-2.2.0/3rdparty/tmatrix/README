This directory contains the Fortran code for the T-Matrix method.

The code has been developed by Michael Mishchenko at the NASA
Goddard Institute for Space Studies, New York. This research
was funded by the NASA Radiation Sciences Program.

tmd.arts.f and ampld.arts.f have been adapted into callable subroutines by
Cory Davis.

Files included in this directory:

tmd.arts.f      # Modified T-Matrix code from PyARTS. This file is used by ARTS
                # because the main program has been converted into a
                # subroutine that is callable from ARTS.
tmd.lp.f.orig   # Original double-precision T-Matrix codes for randomly
                # oriented nonspherical particles
tmd.lp.f        # Same as above but stripped example results to make it compile
                # Compiled into tmatrix_tmd to produce reference output.
tmatrix_tmd.ref # Reference output of the original T-Matrix program.
                # Results of the ARTS WSM TMatrixTest and tmatrix_tmd should
                # be identical to this file.
tmd.par.f       # Parameter file

ampld.arts.f    # Modified T-Matrix code from PyARTS. This file is used by ARTS
                # because the main program has been converted into a
                # subroutine that is callable from ARTS.
ampld.lp.f.orig # Original double-precision T-Matrix codes for nonsperical

ampld.lp.f      # Same as above but stripped example results to make it compile
                # Compiled into tmatrix_ampld to produce reference output.
